    "name": "The effectiveness of standards in driving adoption of sustainability practices",
    "description": "A systematic map of studies published between 1990 and October 2017 that reported evidence of the effects of adopting one (or more) sustainability standards in the thematic broad areas of agriculture (including tea, coffee, cocoa, horticulture, livestock, and dairy), fishing, aquaculture, forestry (embracing forest resources (including forests as carbon sinks or bioreserves), timber, and non-timber products including forest fruits, edible fungi, bushmeat, etc.), textiles, mining, and handicrafts. The studies were selected, using a rigorous filtering process based on best practice guidelines of systematic review, from online bibliographic databases (covering academic journals, conferences, theses, books, and other reports) and from the websites of certification standards organisations. All studies included in the systematic map embraced a research design that included a counterfactual (i.e. controlled studies) in order to provide the basis of evidence comparing certified with non-certified entities. The location of the studies is shown on this searchable geo-map. Where study sites were not provided in the publication, the location of the nearest town is shown. Where a number of studies have been assessed at a research or policy centre, the location of that site is shown. The map allows users to display multiple study attributes, including multiple production systems and multiple certification systems by ‘stashing’ different filters. Results can also be filtered by date of publication by using the slice function and selecting the range of years of interest.",
