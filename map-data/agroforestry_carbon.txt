Changes in soil fauna and soil conditions under Pinus radiata agroforestry regimes during a 25-year tree rotation	Biology and Fertility of Soils	0178-2762	10.1007/s003749900186	<Go to ISI>://WOS:000088324100006	"Pinus radiata was planted in a grazed pasture at Tikitere, New Zealand in 1973; final tree stocking rates were 0, 50, 100, 200 and 400 stems ha(-1); trees were harvested in 1999. We sampled the loamy sand for chemistry, earthworms, enchytraeids and nematodes during crop growth. There were no visible changes in the soil profile between years 2 and 25 of the P. radiata rotation, but marked changes in soil chemistry with pH declining at all depths. Topsoil pH declined but plant-available P and the soil C:N ratio increased. That similar trends occurred in pasture may have reflected reduced inputs. Lumbricid earthworms declined with increasing time and tree stocking rate; significant populations were found only in pasture at 25 years; no related changes in soil bulk density were detected. Enchytraeids were abundant but declined in the plots with 200 and 400 stems ha(-1). The composition of the nematode fauna at a soil depth of 0-10 cm varied, and there were changes in the ""control"" pasture. Pratylenchus sp. and Pungentus sp. were characteristic of pasture; Diphtherophora sp. appeared at higher tree stocking rates. In addition to changes related to the change in landuse there were temporal changes that affected faunal composition across tree stocking rates: Heterodera sp. and Paratylenchus sp. were rare after year 6; Prismatolaimus sp. was most abundant in years 2, 13 and 25; Axonchium sp. occurred in year 6 and Alaimus sp. mainly in year 25. Overall, the changes in soil chemistry reflected the change from pasture to forest. Parallel changes in soil microfauna and macrofauna also reflected the change in landuse, from fertilised pasture to coniferous forest, and are considered reversible."	31	5			New Zealand	North Island	-36.85	174.76	Mixture of sheep and cattle	Beef cattle	Silvopasture		Baseline from implementation					Soil organic carbon		No effect					Yates2000_36	Journal Article	2000	"Yates, C.

Muell woodlands. Vegetation and soil surveys were undertaken in three woodlands with a history of regular grazing and in three woodlands with a history of little or no grazing. Livestock grazing was associated with a decline in native perennial cover and an increase in exotic annual cover, reduced litter cover, reduced soil cryptogam cover, loss of surface soil microtopography, increased erosion, changes in the concentrations of soil nutrients, degradation of surface soil structure, reduced soil water infiltration rates and changes in near ground and soil microclimate. The results suggest that livestock grazing changes woodland conditions and disrupts the resource regulatory processes that maintain the natural biological array in E. salmonophloia woodlands. Consequently the conditions and resources in many remnant woodlands may be above or below critical thresholds for many species. The implications of these findings for restoration of plant species diversity and community structure are discussed. Simply removing livestock from degraded woodlands is unlikely to result in the restoration of plant species diversity and community structure. Restoration will require strategies that capture resources, increase their retention and improve microclimate."	25	1			Australia		-25.274398	133.775136	Sheep		Forest grazing		Forest without grazing					Soil organic carbon		Negative	Negative			Negative	Wocheslander2016_47	Journal Article	2016	"Wocheslander, R.; Harper, R.

This study investigated the option of increasing carbon storage in biomass and poorly productive soils in dryland agricultural systems, while avoiding competition with food production, using tagasaste (Cytisus proliferus Link.), a woody N-fixing perennial species. Perennial plants often have deeper and more extensive root systems than annual plants, and therefore may increase soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks deeper than the IPCC standard sampling depth of 0.3m. Above- and below-ground biomass carbon and SOC to a depth of 2 m were measured on a 22-yr-old replicated field experiment in Western Australia (mean annual rainfall, 498 mm yr(-1)) comparing unmanaged plantations of tagasaste with conventional annual crop and pasture rotations. Carbon sequestration was 2.5 Mg Cha(-1) yr(-1) over the 22-yr lifespan for the tagasaste treatments, with a change of 0.9 Mg Cha(-1) yr(-1) in SOC and 1.6 Mg Cha(-1) yr(-1) in biomass. Tagasaste plots contained significantly larger SOC stocks compared with control plots for soil to 0.9 m, however beyond this depth, treatment differences were not significant. It is recommended that soil sampling be extended to depths of 1 m under such perennial systems with no benefit from sampling to depths deeper than this. In contrast to its current use as a fodder supplement for livestock, this study clearly demonstrates the potential of tagasaste for carbon mitigation within dryland farming systems, especially on soils marginal for conventional agriculture.

No significant difference was found in SOC or TOC between sample times, suggesting that under the conditions we examined, neither 2 years nor an intervening significant rainfall event was sufficient to change the quantity or our capacity to detect SOC, and neither represented a barrier to soil carbon accounting. Low fertility, lightly wooded pastures had a slightly but significantly lower SOC concentration, particularly in the surface soil layers. However, no significant differences in TOC were detected between the three pasture systems studied, and from a carbon estimation perspective, they represent one, single dataset. A wide range in TOC values existed within the dataset that could not be explained by environmental factors. The TOC was weakly but significantly correlated with soil nitrogen and phosphorus, but a more significant pattern seemed to be the association of high TOC with proportionally larger subsoil (0.1-0.3m) organic carbon storage. This we attribute to historical, long-term rather than contemporary management. Of the SOC fractions, particulate organic carbon (POC) dominated in the surface layers but diminished with depth, whereas the proportion of humic carbon (HUM) and resistant organic carbon (ROC) increased with soil depth. The POC did not differ between the pasture systems but native pasture had larger quantities of HUM and ROC, particularly in the surface soil layers, suggesting that this pasture system tends to accumulate organic carbon in more resistant forms, presumably because of litter input quality and historical management."	51	07-Aug			Australia	New South Wales	-32	147	Unclear		Wood pasture		Pasture without trees					Soil organic carbon		Negative					Wilson2007_65	Journal Article	2007	"Wilson, Brian R.; Growns, Ivor; Lemon, John"	"Scattered native trees and soil patterns in grazing land on the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia"	Australian Journal of Soil Research	Apr-73	10.1071/sr07019	<Go to ISI>://WOS:000246571100005	"Over large areas of south-eastern Australia, the original cover of native woodland has been extensively cleared or modi. ed, and what remains is often characterised by scattered trees beneath which the ground-storey vegetation is largely grazed or otherwise managed. This study investigated the influence of scattered Blakely's red gum (Eucalyptus blakelyi) trees on both near-surface and deeper soil layers in temperate grazed pastures on the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia. A significant canopy effect was observed with elevated soil pH, carbon, and nutrient status inside the tree canopy indicating soil enrichment in a zone around the tree. This effect, however, was largely restricted to the surface (0-0.20 m) soil layers. Chloride concentrations were elevated near to trees but only in the deeper soil layers, suggesting that a modi. ed water use and deep drainage mechanism occurred near the trees. Close to the tree, however, a significant acidification was observed between 0.40-0.60 m depth in the soil, without any obvious depletion in other soil element concentrations. It is concluded that this acidi. cation provides strong evidence in support of a 'biological pumping' mechanism that has been proposed elsewhere. Key questions remain as to the management implications of these results, whether the subsurface acidi. cation that was observed is common among native Australian trees, if it might be persistent through time, and if this might be a soil issue that requires management."	45	3			Australia	New South Wales	-32	147	Unclear		Wood pasture		Pasture without trees					Soil organic carbon		Positive					Wilson2002_66	Journal Article	2002	"Wilson, Brian"	Influence of scattered paddock trees on surface soil properties: A study of the Northern Tablelands of NSW	Ecological Management & Restoration	1442-7001	10.1046/j.1442-8903.2002.00115.x	<Go to ISI>://BCI:BCI200300437719	"Surface soil conditions were assessed under three tree species on a property near Armidale on the Northern Tablelands of NSW. In both a stocked and adjacent destocked paddock, five trees each of three eucalypt species: Eucalyptus melliodora, Eucalyptus blakelyi and Eucalyptus nova-anglica, were selected. Soil samples were collected (depth 0-10 cm) along transects 20 m in length running from beneath the tree canopy progressively outwards into the open paddock. Six additional transects were also sampled outside the influence of the trees. Soil properties at a distance from the trees differed little between the stocked and destocked paddock with only a slight acidification in the stocked paddock. However, soil properties around the scattered trees showed considerable variation between stocked and destocked equivalents and most notably in a systematic pattern with distance from the trees themselves. For example, bulk density increased significantly, whereas soil pH, carbon, nitrogen and extractable phosphorus contents all decreased significantly with distance from the trees. However, stocking and camping had modified some of these soil properties. In the stocked paddock, the systematic change in nitrogen and phosphorus with distance from the trees was less clear and the degree of dispersion of the data was largest at the most heavily camped site. In this paddock, bulk density was also generally higher whereas pH, carbon and nitrogen contents were lower compared with the destocked equivalent. Extractable phosphorus content was also higher around the trees in the stocked paddock especially where camping activity was most intense. It is concluded that, although animal camping can modify their effects, scattered trees have a beneficial effect on soil properties and in this respect they have value in the grazing system from a soil conservation perspective."	3	3			Australia	New South Wales	-32	147	Unclear		Wood pasture		Other	Wood pasture without grazing				Soil organic carbon		Mixed results (negative and no effect)					Welsch2016_95i	Journal Article	2016	"Welsch, Johannes; Hale, Roddy J.; Buckley, Hannah L.; Case, Bradley S."

This is particularly true in intensively-farmed landscapes where it is of interest to quantify the role of small, woody vegetation features in providing ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration. However, soil variability introduced by natural and management processes can interact with sampling designs to result in inappropriate sampling intensities and high levels of uncertainty in measured indicators. This can have consequences for upscaling of ecosystem quantities and decision making. Here, we present results from a pilot study aimed at quantifying and understanding variation in ten common indicators of soil condition and function, within shelterbelt and adjacent field soils, at four dryland sheep farms in Canterbury, New Zealand. Our results demonstrate a high level of spatially-structured soil variability, driven by (1) the effects of woody vegetation on shelterbelt soils relative to field soils, (2) differences in underlying soil types among sites, and (3) possible effects of grazing animals within fields. This soil variability had clear knock-on impacts for appropriate sampling effort, depending on the soil indicator in question, the original soil sampling density, and whether the aim was to estimate population mean values or to detect differences among sites with confidence. On the whole, confidence in soil indicator estimates was highest for soil condition indicators (pH, soil moisture, bulk density), variable for carbon quantities, depending on the measure used, and lowest for soil biological process indicators (tea bag index decomposition rate, bait lamina probe micro-invertebrate activity, and dehydrogenase enzyme activity); estimation confidence was also mostly lower for shelterbelt soils due to the effect of woody roots and inputs on soil variability. Based on our results, we present indicative sample size requirements to estimate population means for these different soil indicators. Ultimately, we advocate for the use of pilot studies, such as the one presented here, to facilitate understanding of variability in soil function indicators within different agroecosystems, and how this variability is partitioned spatially within and among vegetated features. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"	102			Agroecosystem; Carbon; Estimation; Multi-functionality; Power analysis; Sampling intensity; Scaling up; Soil indicator; Spatial variation; Woody vegetation; Decision making; Enzyme activity; Forestry; Soil moisture; Vegetation; Agro ecosystems; Multifunctionality; Scaling-up; Spatial variations; Ecosystems; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural soil; carbon sequestration; decomposition; ecosystem service; environmental indicator; environmental monitoring; population estimation; sampling; shelterbelt; soil carbon; uncertainty analysis; upscaling; Canterbury [South Island]; New Zealand; South Island; Animalia; Invertebrata; Ovis aries	New Zealand	Canterbury	-33.9126	151.118	Sheep		Shelterbelt/Windbreak		Pasture without trees					Belowground carbon (plant roots)		No effect					Walden2017_121	Journal Article	2017	"Walden, L.

Atriplex nummularia Lindl. is a perennial shrub commonly established for livestock forage on saline land, however, its potential for carbon mitigation has not been systematically evaluated. Similarly, although revegetation is an allowable activity to mitigate carbon within Article 3.4 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's Kyoto Protocol, there is a paucity of information on rates of carbon mitigation in soils and biomass through this mechanism. For six sites where A. nummularia had been established across southern Australia four were used to assess changes in soil carbon storage and four were used to develop biomass carbon sequestration estimates. A generalised allometric equation for above and below ground biomass was developed, with a simple crown volume index explaining 81% of the variation in total biomass. There were no significant differences in soil organic carbon storage to 0.3 m or 2 m depth compared to existing agricultural land-use. Between 2.2 and 8.3 Mg C ha(-1) or 0.2-0.6 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) was sequestered in above and below ground biomass and this translates to potential total sequestration of 1.1-3.6 Tg C yr(-1) on saline land across Australia. Carbon income and forage grazing may thus provide a means to finance the stabilization of compromised land. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The response of soil respiration (Rs) to grazing and tilling practices and trees canopy influence were studied in a dehesa ecosystem in the center of Spain from July 2008 to February 2010. Four different treatments were established: non grazed-non tilled; non grazed-tilled; grazed-non tilled and grazed and tilled. In all the treatments R-s, soil temperature (T-s), soil moisture (M-s), soil C and N stocks were measured. Grazing reduced Rs by 12 % across all experiment. Increments of 3 Mg/ha in C stocks and 0.3 Mg/ha in N stocks in grazing soils were observed. Although, no clear tilling effect on Rs was found, a decrease of 3.5 Mg/ha in soil C stocks and 0.3 Mg/ha in N stocks was detected in tilled soils. Presence of tree canopy induced increases in Rs, soil C and N stocks; while decreases in T-s were observed, but grazing decreased the tree canopy influence on annual C losses by Rs. The M-s constrained the temperature response of Rs during the experiment, and meaningful Q10 values were only obtainable during the wettest time, ranging from 2.5 to 5.7. Grazing and tree canopy had a positive influence in the ability of soils to store soil C and N, while tilling had a negative effect on soil C and N store capacity in this study.

Soil organic carbon was measured in pasture, silvopastoral tree, and woodland treatments at six depths representative of 0-150 cm. Fourteen years after tree planting, the organic carbon content in the surface soil layer (0-10 cm) was greatest in the pasture (6.0 g 100 g(-1)) and least in the woodland (4.6 g 100 g(-1)); the value (5.3 g 100 g(-1)) below the silvopastoral trees was intermediate. In the 10-20 cm layer, the organic carbon content in the woodland was 13% lower than the pasture. No treatment effects on soil carbon were detected below 20 cm. Possible reasons for the decline in surface soil carbon include a decline in grass cover and reduced soil water content Measurements of above ground carbon storage by the trees indicated that tree planting increased overall carbon storage, with the silvopastoral system predicted to achieve a higher level of carbon storage than equivalent areas of separate woodland and pasture. A power analysis indicates that a prohibitively large number of replicates is needed to ensure a lower than 20% risk of falsely concluding no treatment differences at individual depth increments below 10 cm and cumulative depths extending below 40 cm.

This was verified by a qualitative similarity analysis, in which the five dehesas formed a group clearly distinguishable from the other sites; the oak shrublands also formed a group, but it was not possible to distinguish between the mature oak forests with and without a shrubby understory. However, the soil characteristics were similar across all sites and differences could only be detected in organic matter and nitrogen content, which were significantly higher in the mature forests without a shrubby understory. When the plant community and soil characteristics were analysed as a whole using a canonical correspondence analysis, the separation of the dehesas was observed on the first axis, due to its greater richness and abundance in herb species, especially annuals. The other sites were ordered on the second axis, with greater differences between the oak shrublands, associated with higher shrub species cover, and the mature open forests, associated with forest herb species and a soil with a higher nitrogen, organic matter and cation exchange content. The mature forests with abundant shrub biomass were in an intermediate position. Therefore, although the differences in soil were not important and many species were common to all types of Q. pyrenaica communities, the type of human intervention did determine changes, as shown by the results of the multifactorial analyses. In addition, given that all the community types presented some species which were not found in the other types, greater biodiversity would be attained by preserving all of them.

However, since nearly all of these reports have been time-point comparisons, utilizing long-term paired-sites, properties of transitional states and time of their appearance can only be inferred at present. In this study, a deciduous forest ecosystem was converted to a silvopasture ecosystem by tree thinning, fertilization, and sheep incorporation of seed and forest litter. After 2 years, topsoil (0-15 cm) physico-chemical properties, particularly P fractions, and phosphatases were monitored over the growing season in these ecosystems, and a nearby pasture ecosystem. Initially, before spring vegetative growth, differences were found for pH, exchangeable cations and soil moisture, most of which could be explained by management history. Compared to forest, organic-C (C(o)) and organic-N (N(o)) concentrations were reduced in silvopasture by 17 and 9%, respectively, indicative of substantial litter decomposition. Most values for all these physico-chemical properties for silvopasture were intermediate between forest and pasture, and generally remained so throughout the growing season. Initial total P (TP(t)), organic-P (TP(o)) and inorganic-P (TP(i)) concentrations were generally as anticipated for the forest and pasture. Silvopasture, however, had 36 and 23% greater TP(o) than forest and pasture, respectively, presumably due to fertilizer-P immobilization induced by incorporation of forest litter. Total P components remained essentially constant over the growing season in all ecosystems, with the exception of pasture, likely due to high forage TP(i) uptake. Bray I-extractable-organic-P (BrP(o)) and bicarbonate-extractable-organic-P (BiP(o)) concentrations, although consistently highest in the forest and silvopasture soils, were not reflective of the increase in TP(o) under silvopasture. Acid phosphatase (PMEac) activities were highest in spring in all the ecosystems, then gradually declined to typically 25-50% initial activities. Alkaline phosphatase (PMEal) activities showed a broadly-similar pattern, with exception of forest and silvopasture soils, which exhibited low activities throughout the season. For the entire data set, PMEac and PMEal activities were poorly correlated with TP(i,) BrP(i), and BiP(i). These results demonstrate that conversion of forest to silvopasture results in soil changes indicative of its rapid transition to pasture and that an increased P(o) reservoir results that should be taken into account in fertilizer-P recommendations for temperate silvopastures."	74	3	114-127		USA	West Virginia	37.48	-80.58	Sheep		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees					Soil organic carbon		Positive					Simon2013_284	Journal Article	2013	"Simon, Nuria; Montes, Fernando; Diaz-Pines, Eugenio; Benavides, Raquel; Roig, Sonia; Rubio, Agustin"	Spatial distribution of the soil organic carbon pool in a Holm oak dehesa in Spain	Plant and Soil	0032-079X	10.1007/s11104-012-1443-9	<Go to ISI>://WOS:000317988600039	"Dehesas are agroforestry systems characterized by scattered trees among pastures, crops and/or fallows.

The Universal Kriging technique was used to assess the spatial distribution of the soil organic carbon stocks, using tree coverage within a buffering area as an auxiliary variable. A significant positive correlation between tree presence and soil organic carbon stocks up to distances of around 8 m from the trees was found. The tree crown cover within a buffer up to a distance similar to the crown radius around the point absorbed 30 % of the variance in the model for both grazing intensities, but residual variance showed stronger spatial autocorrelation under regular grazing conditions.

This fact in combination with climate change and conversion of forestland to pasture may significantly affect the soil-atmosphere greenhouse gases (GHGs) exchange. Our study evaluates the impact of oak trees as compared to pasture on net ecosystem GHG (CH4, N2O, and CO2) exchange as well as the main environmental factors influencing this exchange. We used field chamber measurements for the collection of GHGs under three different conditions: 1) open area (OA), 2) under tree canopy area (UC) and 3) improved pasture (IP). Experiments were done under typical Mediterranean climate at central Portugal in 2010 and 2011. The UC had higher nitrification potential, soil C/N ratio, electrical conductivity, litter input and soil organic matter (SOM) than OA and IP. SOM positively correlated with soil CH4 and N2O fluxes but not with soil CO2 respiration rates. Soil water content (SWC) drives both CH4 and N2O fluxes. Under certain conditions, when SWC reached a threshold (7 % for CH4 and 3 % for N2O) the result was net uptake and that net uptake increased with SWC. This was the case for the UC and OA. Conversely, for the IP soil water content above 4 % promoted net CH4 release. Our results show that cork oak influences soil properties and consequently GHGs fluxes. In the UC the input of litter for SOM together with soil moisture, favoured microbiological activity and related GHGs fluxes. Soil temperature is a secondary factor in the studied conditions. Our results also emphasized the potential impact posed by decreased cork oak tree density in the functioning of the ""montado"" ecosystem."	374	01-Feb	75-80		Portugal		39.08	-8.2	Unclear		Dehesa/Montado		Pasture without trees					Soil organic carbon		Positive					Sharrow2004_314	Journal Article	2004	"Sharrow, S.

In contrast, temperate conifer forests often store large amounts of organic matter above-ground in woody plant tissue and fibrous litter. Silvopastures, which combine managed pastures with forest trees, should accrete more carbon and nitrogen than pastures or timber plantations because they may produce more total annual biomass and have both forest and grassland nutrient cycling patterns active. This hypothesis was investigated by conducting carbon and nitrogen inventories on three replications of 11 year-old Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)/perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne)/subclover (Trifolium subterraneum) agroforests, ryegrass/subclover pastures, and Douglas-fir timber plantations near Corvallis, Oregon in August 2000. Over the 11 years since planting, agroforests accumulated approximately 740 kg ha-1 year-1 more C than forests and 520 kg ha-1 year-1 more C than pastures. Agroforests stored approximately 12% of C and 2% of N aboveground compared to 9% of C and 1% of N above ground in plantations and less than 1% of N and C aboveground in pastures. Total N content of agroforests and pastures, both of which included a nitrogen-fixing legume, were approximately 530 and 1200 kg ha-1 greater than plantations, respectively. These results support the proposition that agroforests, such as silvopastures, may be more efficient at accreting C than plantations or pasture monocultures. However, pastures may accrete more N than agroforests or plantations. This apparent separation of response in obviously interrelated agroecosystem processes, points out the difficulty in using forest plantation or pasture research results to predict outcomes for mixed systems such as agroforests."	60	2	48-62	agroforestry; agroforestry systems; carbon; carbon sequestration; forest plantations; nitrogen; nitrogen fixation; nitrogen fixing trees; nutrient content; pastures; silvopastoral systems; soil organic matter; trees; woody plants	USA	Oregon	44.4	-123	Sheep		Silvopasture		Other	Pasture without trees AND forest without grazing				Total carbon		Positive					Serrano2018_323	Journal Article	2018	"Serrano, Joao; Shahidian, Shakib; Marques Da Silva, J.; Sales-Baptista, E.; Ferraz De Oliveira, I.; Lopes De Castro, J.; Pereira, Alfredo; Cancela De Abreu, M.; Machado, Eliana; de Carvalho, Mario"	Tree influence on soil and pasture: contribution of proximal sensing to pasture productivity and quality estimation in montado ecosystems	International Journal of Remote Sensing	0143-1161	10.1080/01431161.2017.1404166	<Go to ISI>://WOS:000441646800014	"Montado is a silvo-pastoral ecosystem of the Mediterranean region, a mixed system of trees and pasture, subject to animal grazing. Farmers need information on pasture production and quality in order to assess the direct effect of tree presence on the productivity of their pastoral system, and to devise management that balances farm production and profitability with sustainable soil management. The main objectives of this work were (1) to evaluate tree influence on soil and pasture parameters and (2) to evaluate the use of proximal sensing techniques that have potential for monitoring aspects related to spatial and temporal variability of pasture productivity and quality in montado ecosystems. Both objectives can support the decision-making process of the farmer. The study field is located in Mitra farm, in Southern Portugal. During October 2015, 24 geo-referenced composite soil samples (12 under tree canopy and 12 outside tree canopy) were collected from the 0.0-0.3m soil layer. The soil samples were analysed for texture (sand, silt, and clay content), moisture content, pH, organic matter, total nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), and manganese (Mn). The evolution of the pasture was recorded in the 24 sampling points at five monitoring dates: at the end of autumn (December 2015), at the end of winter (March 2016), and then monthly during spring 2016 (April, May, and June). The following pasture parameters were measured: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), capacitance, temperature, green and dry matter, ash, crude protein (CP), and neutral detergent fibre. Soil under tree canopy had significantly higher levels of organic matter, N, P, K, and Mg, and better pasture quality while the pasture productivity was higher outside tree canopy. The correlation between pasture direct measurements and sensor parameters was more consistent between capacitance and pasture productivity and between NDVI and CP. The use of fast and efficient tools associated with geo-referenced systems can greatly simplify the pasture monitoring process, which is the basis for estimating feed availability in the field. The knowledge of biomass quality and quantity is fundamental to support decision-making regarding animal stocking rates and rotation among grazing parcels."	39	14	81-87		Portugal		38.3	-8.01	Sheep		Dehesa/Montado		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Negative	Soil organic carbon		Positive					Seddaiu2013_328	Journal Article	2013	"Seddaiu, Giovanna; Porcu, Giovanna; Ledda, Luigi; Roggero, Pier Paolo; Agnelli, Alberto; Corti, Giuseppe"	Soil organic matter content and composition as influenced by soil management in a semi-arid Mediterranean agro-silvo-pastoral system	Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment	0167-8809	10.1016/j.agee.2013.01.002	<Go to ISI>://WOS:000317326700001	"The aim of this study was to assess the impact of different long term soil managements on soil organic matter (SOM) quantity and quality in a semi-arid Mediterranean dehesa-like agro-forestry system (North-East of Sardinia, Italy). Seven soil managements were compared: cork oak forest, pasture under oak trees, open pasture, hay crop under oak trees, open hay crop, grass-covered vineyard and tilled vineyard. Analyses include chemical and spectroscopic (FT-IR) characterization of the humic substances (fulvic acids, humic acids and humin) of the A horizons. Lower amounts of total organic C and humic substances were found in the more disturbed soils such as those of the tilled vineyard, while the other soil managements showed a rather similar pattern for many indices of SOM quality (e.g., HA-C/FA-C, fulvic H/C and humic and fulvic C/N ratios) and for spectroscopic characteristics. These results indicated that the impact of soil management on the humic composition was relatively low for these sub-acid (pH ranging from 5.1 to 6.4) sandy soils under Mediterranean type of climate. The relatively small differences between the forest and the grassland land uses also suggested that the periodical light tillage applied to the grassland did not strongly affect SOM accumulation in the topsoil of this land use. In the oak forest soils, a sharp decrease (-77%) of the organic C from the thin A1 to the A2 horizon was observed, which could constrain the resilience of these soils towards disturbance factors, while the grasslands soils, where the organic C sequestration occurred in a thick horizon, may be more resilient. The compared soil managements revealed to be quite conservative, demonstrating that the traditional agro-silvo-pastoral management practices are effective in maintaining relatively good soil quality traits under semi-arid Mediterranean conditions.

Positions below and outside the canopy of three cork oak trees in each field were randomly selected to compare seasonal pasture production, pasture utilization rate by animals, botanical composition, biodiversity indicators (Shannon index and plant species richness) and soil organic carbon. In autumn, dry matter production of pasture was similar in the two positions; in two winters out of three it was greater below the trees than outside, and in spring it was greater outside than below the trees. While plant species richness and Shannon index were not significantly influenced by the position, the overall wooded grassland plant species richness was 31% higher than that outside of the tree crown. The soil organic carbon content in the 0-40-cm soil layer was also higher below the trees. Our findings highlight that if the main purpose of the wooded grasslands is to provide forage for grazing animals rather than conserving and/or enhancing plant diversity and soil fertility, the presence of trees constrains the overall forage productivity, although the greater forage availability in winter under the trees can contribute to improve the seasonal distribution of forage production."	92	4	271-275		Italy	Sardinia	40.47	9.1	Unclear		Dehesa/Montado		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Mixed results (positive and negative)	Soil organic carbon		Positive					Scott2006_330	Journal Article	2006	"Scott, N.

Don in New Zealand has led to the establishment of over 600 000 ha of new plantation forests, about 85% of which are on fertile pastures used previously for grazing sheep and cattle. While this leads to rapid accumulation of carbon ( C) in vegetation, the effects of afforestation on soil C are poorly understood. We examined key soil C cycling processes at the ( former) Tikitere agroforestry experimental site near Rotorua, New Zealand. In 1973, replicated stands of P. radiata ( 100 and 400 stems/ha) were established on pastures, while replicated pasture plots were maintained throughout the first 26-year rotation. In 1996, soil C and microbial biomass C in 0 - 0.10 m depth soil, in situ soil respiration and net N mineralisation, and soil temperature were lower in the forest than in the pasture, and tended to decline with increasing tree-stocking density. In the 400 stems/ha stands, mineral soil C ( 0 - 0.50m depth) was lower than in the pasture ( 104 and 126 Mg C/ha, respectively; P< 0.01). Carbon accumulation in the forest floor during the first rotation of these forest stands was 12 Mg C/ha. Using the Rothamsted soil C model (Roth-C), we examined how changes in plant C inputs following afforestation might lead to changes in soil C content to 0.30 m depth. Steady-state pasture inputs of 9.0 Mg C/ha. year were estimated using Roth-C; these C inputs were assumed to decrease linearly during the first 12 years following tree establishment ( until canopy closure). Below-ground C inputs in the forest were estimated using steady-state relationships between litterfall and soil respiration; these inputs were assumed to increase linearly between years 1 and 12, after which they remained constant at 1.53 Mg C/ha. year until harvest. Measured changes in soil C (0-0.30 m) during the first rotation, in conjunction with the below-ground inputs, were used to estimate above-ground inputs ( as a proportion of total litterfall [3.81 Mg C/ha. year]) to the soil. Our results suggest 10% of litterfall C over one rotation actually entered the mineral soil. Using these results and estimates of additional C inputs to the soil from harvest slash and weeds following harvest, we found mineral-soil C stocks would continue to decline during second and third rotations of P. radiata; the magnitude of this decline depended in part on how much slash enters the mineral soil matrix. We confirmed our modelling approach by simulating soil C changes to within 8% over 19 years following afforestation of pasture at another previously studied site, Purukohukohu. Whether afforestation leads to an increase or decrease in mineral-soil C may depend on previous pasture management; in highly productive pastures, high C inputs to the soil may maintain soil C at levels that cannot be sustained when trees are planted onto these grasslands."	44	2	3-4		New Zealand		-38.9	175.84	Unclear		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees					Soil organic carbon		Negative					Sanchez2015_369	Journal Article	2015	"Sanchez, I.

Both are agroforestry systems in which domestic stock are pastured: amongst parklike trees in dehesa, and in enclosures surrounded by stone walls and woody vegetation in hedged fields. The latter are now tending to be replaced by dehesa due to labour costs. Here, we investigate the boundary layer microclimate and environmental characteristics of these two land uses in order to evaluate the respective differences in relation to climate modification, soil organic carbon, and soil water content. Fraxinus angustifolia-dominated sites were investigated in the Guadarrama mountains, Spain, in high summer with simultaneous sampling under trees in both dehesa and hedgerows and in adjacent open fields. Whilst temperature profiles were similar in both systems, hedgerows had higher soil water content, lower wind speeds, and higher total soil organic carbon compared to dehesa, and moreover these trends also applied to open fields of the respective systems. We conclude that not only do hedged fields have advantages over dehesa for shelter and production, but that the climatic modifications of hedged field systems potentially modify boundary layer climates on a broader scale than both individual fields and dehesa. Thus, the conservation of hedged field systems provides natural capital and broad environmental gains. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Agroforestry resulted in a 15-25% decline in soil organic C and N compared with grassland, and had a significant negative influence on soil microbial biomass. There was less microbial C and N in soils under 50-400 stems/ha of P. radiata than in soils under grassland (0 stems/ha). Soil carbon decomposition and microbial activity were measured by trapping the carbon dioxide produced by incubating soils over a 60-week period. The results showed that soil C decomposition rates were similar to1.5 times as much (c. 15 mg CO2-C/kg soil) in soil from grassland as in that from plots with 50 or100 stems/ha (c. 10 mg CO2-C/kg soil), and were further reduced to one half (c. 5.5 mg CO2-C/kg soil) in the plots with 200 or 400 stems/ha. The soils under P. radiata gave off less carbon dioxide per unit of biomass (the metabolic quotient) than soils under grassland. These shifts in microbial biomass and its metabolic quotients appear to be associated with differences in the quantity and 'quality' of inputs and soil organic matter decomposition rates, and to reflect the land use change from grassland to forest.

Additionally, the chemical nature of the soil organic C in the vegetation belts will be compared with C from adjacent grassland soils to identify whether the trees are sequestering a more stable form of soil C than the grasslands.

This study investigated the effects of Acacia melanoxylon on soil nitrogen (N) levels, N availability, soil pH, bulk density, organic carbon, C: N ratios and soil moisture in three separate silvopastoral sites with contrasting soil types in the North Island of New Zealand. At each site four tree stocking rates were studied (0, 500, 800, and 1700 stems ha(-1)). The trees were nine years old at the time of the study. Soil samples from each study site were taken once at three depths (0 to 75 mm, 75 to 150 mm, and 150 to 300 mm), with three replicates per tree stocking rate. Soil analyses showed that although there were differences between soil types, few statistically significant differences occurred due to tree stocking rate. A greenhouse pot trial growing ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L. cv. 'Concord') in soil from the 'A' horizon of each soil type from under the trees and the open pasture found that ryegrass yield, N uptake and N supply increased with increasing tree stocking rate. Increased N supply under the trees, coupled with greater soil moisture compared to the open pasture may have accounted for the higher pasture yield under Acacia melanoxylon compared to non dinitrogen fixing tree species.

Don in 1973. Measurements made in 1991 and 1992 showed that after 18 years soil pH had declined and that Olsen phosphorus levels increased with increased tree stocking. Soil magnesium also declined at the higher tree stocking rates. We made further measurements on samples collected in 1991 and 1992 to determine reasons for the change in nutrient status. Soil carbon and soil organic phosphorus in the surface soil (0-75 mm depth) decreased with tree stocking, indicating increased net mineralisation of soil organic matter under P. radiata compared with pasture. Exchangeable cations and cation exchange capacity also declined with tree stocking, which is consistent with the loss of exchange sites in soil organic matter. Total soil inorganic phosphorus declined with increased tree stocking. This was expected because of reduced fertiliser phosphorus input at the higher stocking rates. However, phosphorus fractionation showed that bicarbonate-extractable inorganic phosphorus increased and acid-extractable inorganic phosphorus declined with tree stocking. The latter indicated possible decreases in soil apatite phosphorus. These results were consistent with the mobilisation of soil phosphorus under P. radiata by dissolution of fluorapatite (in parent material deposited during the 1886 Tarawera eruption) due to lower soil pH values and mineralisation of organic phosphorus previously accumulated under pasture. Consequently, Olsen phosphorus has increased despite reduced phosphorus fertiliser applications. Microbiological activity (as indicated by microbial biomass and microbial respiration) and phosphatase activities of soil samples collected in 1995 also decreased with tree stocking, and so mineralisation of organic matter was not a result of microbial activity alone. However, the proportion of soil aggregates > 0.5 mm decreased under P. radiata, indicating there was less physical protection of the soil organic matter than under pasture where soil aggregates were maintained by fine roots."	29	1	1004-1006		New Zealand		-40.900557	174.885971	Sheep		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees					Soil organic carbon		Negative					Paudel2012_619	Journal Article	2012	"Paudel, Bodh R.; Udawatta, Ranjith P.; Kremer, Robert J.; Anderson, Stephen H."

Four management treatments [grazed pasture (GP), agroforestry buffer (AgB), grass buffer (GB) and row crop (RC)] were sampled in 2009 and 2010 at two depths (0 to 10- and 10 to 20-cm) and analyzed. Most of the soil quality indicators were significantly greater under perennial vegetation when compared to row crop treatments. Although there were numerical variations, soil quality response trends were consistent between years. The beta-glucosaminidase activity increased slightly from 156 to 177 mu g PNP g(-1) dry soil while beta-glucosidase activity slightly decreased from 248 to 237 mu g PNP g(-1) dry soil in GB treatment during 2 years. The surface (0-10 cm depth) had greater enzyme activities and WSA than sub-surface (10-20 cm) samples. WSA increased from 178 to 314 g kg(-1) in row crop areas while all other treatments had similar values during the 2 year study. The treatment by depth interaction was significant (P < 0.05) for beta-glucosidase and beta-glucosaminidase enzymes in 2009 and for dehydrogenase and beta-glucosaminidase in 2010. Soil enzyme activities were significantly correlated with soil organic carbon content (r a parts per thousand yen 0.94, P < 0.0001). This is important because soil enzyme activities and microbial biomass can be enhanced by perennial vegetation and thus improve several other soil quality parameters. These results also support the hypothesis that positive interactions among management practices, soil biota and subsequent environmental quality effects are of great agricultural and ecological importance."	84	2	43-54		USA	Missouri	37.2	-92.74	Cattle		Riparian strip		Pasture without trees					Soil organic carbon		No effect					Ovalle2006_669	Journal Article	2006	"Ovalle, Carlos; Del Pozo, Alejandro; Casado, Miguel A.; Acosta, Belen; de Miguel, Jose M."

The effects of landscape heterogeneity on the diversity and productivity of herbaceous plant communities were studied in 29 plots of 1000 m(2), with a wide range of woody cover. A detrended correspondence analysis of the species x plots matrix explained 73% of the total variation and revealed the existence of two trends of variation in floristic composition: one associated with physiographic position (hillsides and flatlands) and the other related to the number of years since the last cutting, or coppicing, of A. caven. Despite the great majority of the original herbaceous species having disappeared as a result of the prevailing land use system, some native species have been able to survive especially on hillside areas with low grazing intensity. Woody cover was a good indicator of spatial heterogeneity and land use history. It was also correlated with stocking rate, above-ground biomass of herbaceous vegetation, and soil fertility (organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus concentration), both on hillsides and flatlands. The relationship between woody cover and herbaceous plant species richness was significant and unimodal in flat land areas, and linear, and marginally significant, on hillsides.

With regard to global changes in land use, the present study aimed at (i) investigating the influence of grazing on flux rates of methane in forest soils, (ii) deducing possible (a) biotic factors regulating these fluxes, and (iii) gaining an insight into the complex interactions between methane-cycling microorganisms and ecosystem functioning. Here we show that extensive grazing significantly mitigated the soil's sink strength for atmospheric methane through alterations of both microbial activity and community composition. In situ flux measurements revealed that all native, non-grazed areas were net methane consumers, while the adjacent, grazed areas were net methane producers. Whereas neither parent material nor soil properties including moisture and organic matter showed any correlation to the ascertained fluxes, significantly higher archaeal abundances at the grazed study sites indicated that small inputs of methanogens associated with cattle grazing may be sufficient to sustainably increase methane emissions."	94	5	181-189		Austria		47.41	11.57	Cattle		Forest grazing		Forest without grazing					GHG emissions		Negative					Mosquera-Losada2010_805	Journal Article	2010	"Mosquera-Losada, M.

Tree plantation is recognized as a way to reduce nutrient leaching and increase land profitability in agronomic and forest soils, meanwhile pasture fertilization and sowing is usually associated to better pasture productivity and quality. Fertilization can be performed with mineral fertilizers, which have become expensive in recent times, or with organic fertilizers like sludge, which is being promoted worldwide. This study aims to evaluate the effects of sludge fertilization, tree planting and pasture sowing on different variables of soil (KCl-pH, cation exchange capacity, total N, total and Mehlich P, nitrate and soil organic matter) and pasture (production, botanical composition, crude protein and P concentration) in treeless and agroforestry systems established in forest and agronomic soils. The experimental design was a randomized block following an incomplete factorial design with three replicates and nine treatments including two types of soils (forestry and agronomic), two types of vegetation (natural and sown), two types of fertilization (sludge fertilization and mineral fertilization, with a no fertilizer control) in afforested and treeless pastures. Pasture production and quality was better under agronomic soils, which also had higher levels of KCl-pH, cation exchange capacity, nitrate, total N and P than forest soils. Tree establishment did not modify nitrate or P leaching, probably due to the youth of the trees when most of nitrate was leached at the beginning of the experiment, but reduction of soil KCl pH and pasture crude protein was found in forest soils, when trees and pasture were together established, probably due to the high extractions of these systems compared with unsown forests. Moreover, the sludge inputs increased pasture production better than the mineral fertilizer in the forest soils, probably due to the greater amount of nutrients applied by the former. Sowing enhanced the presence of sown grasses in the forest understory, but their presence reduced pasture quality, and they disappeared within a short period of time. Therefore, the use of the sludge as fertilizer allows nutrient recycling of this residue in soils of low fertility and increases productivity and preserves fertility compared with mineral fertilizer at short (forest soils) and medium (agronomic soils) term."	139	4	421-434	afforestation; agricultural soils; agroforestry systems; cation exchange capacity; crude protein; cycling; farming systems; fertilizers; forest plantations; forest soils; grassland soils; grasslands; nitrate; nitrogen; organic fertilizers; pastoralism; pastures; phosphorus; pines; potassium chloride; productivity; protein content; silvopastoral systems; sludges; soil fertility; soil organic matter; soil pH; soil properties; sown grasslands; species composition; trees; woody plants	Spain	Galicia	42.5	-8.1	Pasture without trees		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		No effect	Soil organic matter		No effect		No effect			McHenry2009_913	Journal Article	2009	"McHenry, Melinda T.; Wilson, Brian R.; Lockwood, Peter V.; Guppy, Christopher N.; Sindel, Brian M.; Tighe, Matthew K.; Growns, Ivor O.; Lemon, John M."

We investigated soil chemical and groundcover patterns associated with individual small and large C. glaucophylla trees at six sites of variable management history and lithology in NWNSW, Australia. We posed two questions: ( 1) do individual C. glaucophylla trees impose patterns on soil and groundcover ( soil extractable P, C, N, Sand pH, litter biomass, litter P and pasture cover), and, ( 2) if patterns exist, do they differ between tree sizes? Results showed that extractable P, C and pH decreased away from trees of both sizes, but significantly higher values were recorded adjacent to the stem of large trees. Litter biomass exhibited a strong site-related trend independent of soil variables. Positive correlations between litter and soil variables existed for some sites and not others, indicative of processes such as grazing which contribute to the transport of litter away from the tree. Irrespective of tree size ground-storey vegetation cover increased significantly away from the stem, presumably as a consequence of competition for soil water. Further results indicated that single C. glaucophylla trees enrich soils in patterns analogous to other species in similar environments worldwide. However, localised soil improvements must be weighed up against the negative effects of decreased groundcover associated with trees, and the potential for the species to re-seed prolifically into managed paddocks. Future research will discern the impact of individual C. glaucophylla trees at higher densities, where soil patterning may be modified by intense within-stand competition."	31	3	93-100		Australia	New South Wales	-30.05	142.66	Mixture of sheep and cattle		Wood pasture		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Decrease with increased tree density/cover/proximity	Total soil carbon		Positive					McAdam2018_930	Journal Article	2018	"McAdam, J.

In Europe, there is growing interest in establishing high quality wood plantations with intensive management comprising irrigation, fertilisation and chemical weed control to reduce rotation length. However, these operations can have major environmental impacts similar to the effects of intensive agriculture, such as impoverishment of soil C. The aim of this study is to identify optimum management practices for intensive systems of quality wood production to optimise soil C stock and plantation productivity. An experiment was conducted in Extremadura, mid-west Spain, from 2011 to 2014, in a 13 year-old hybrid walnut (Juglans major x regia mj 209xra) plantation with a density of 333 trees ha(-1). Two essays were established: one with three techniques to control competition from herbaceous strata beneath trees - mowing, ploughing and sheep grazing (1 sheep ha(-)1)- and the other to test implementation of legumes (mixture of Trifolium michelanium and Ornithopus compressus complemented by the same quantities of phosphorous and potassium as mineral treatment) as an alternative to traditional mineral fertilisation (40 kg N ha(-1), 40 kg P205 ha(-1) and 50 kg K2O ha(-1)). The C stock estimate was based on soil organic carbon (SOC) and aboveground (tree trunks and branches) and belowground biomass (tree and pasture roots). Most of the C stock was contained in SOC, at 50% in the uppermost soil layer (025 cm), followed by aboveground biomass. The response of SOC in each treatment was higher than the other parameters analysed, suggesting that SOC is a more sensitive pool to management techniques. Grazing as control of herbaceous vegetation and legume implementation as nitrogen supply are suitable techniques for optimising soil C stocks and also achieve adequate tree growth in the longer term.

In this study, the effects of three different agroforestry systems (hedgerow, shelterbelt, and silvopasture) and their component land-cover types (treed area and adjacent herbland) on SOC stock in LFH and mineral soil layers (0-75 cm) were investigated across 36 sites in central Alberta, Canada. The SOC stock of mineral soil (0-75 cm) was not affected by agroforestry systems but by land-cover type. The treed area had greater (p < 0.001) SOC in the 0-75 cm mineral soil (25.5 kg C m(-2)) than the herbland (19.4 kg C m(-2)), driven by the greater (p < 0.001) SOC level in the top 0-30 cm rather than that in the deeper layers (30-75 cm). Within the treed area, the silvopasture system that was dominated by broad-leaf deciduous trees had 56-70% more SOC in the 0-10 cm soil than in the hedgerow and shelterbelt systems. The SOC stock in the 0-10 cm layer was positively (p = 0.025) related to the C stock of the overlying LFH layer in the silvopasture system. These results together with the 22-24% higher dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration in the silvopasture than in the other systems suggest that the greater SOC stock in the 0-10 cm mineral soil could be attributed to the higher rates of translocation of DOC from the LFH in the silvopasture than that in shelterbelt or hedgerow. We conclude that SOC stock in the top mineral soil (e.g., 0-30 cm) is more responsive to changes in land-cover type and the LFH layer plays an important role in increasing SOC stock in the surface mineral soil of the agroforestry systems in central Alberta."	417		57-65		Canada	Alberta	55.19	-115.12	Unclear		Silvopasture	AND shelterbelt AND hedge	Pasture without trees					Soil organic carbon		Positive					Lai2014_1140	Journal Article	2014	"Lai, Roberto; Lagomarsino, Alessandra; Ledda, Luigi; Roggero, Pier Paolo"	Variation in soil C and microbial functions across tree canopy projection and open grassland microenvironments	Turkish Journal of Agriculture and Forestry	1300-011X	10.3906/tar-1303-82	<Go to ISI>://WOS:000328624300008	"Mixtures of grasslands and perennial woody crops or vineyards represent a major source of potential carbon storage or release.

Eight microenvironments characterized by different long-term soil management practices and different positions with respect to woody plant canopy soil vertical projections were selected in a Mediterranean agropastoral system. Four management types were considered: pasture, hay crop, grass-covered vineyard, and tilled vineyard. Soil organic C, microbial biomass, and respiration were measured to assess C storage and dynamics, while functional diversity was determined by means of soil enzyme activities. The results showed that the microenvironmental variation of soil organic C and functional microbial diversity generated by the tree canopies in the wooded grassland can be very relevant for an accurate assessment of soil organic C content and its dynamics. The same was not applicable to vineyards, where the spatial variation of both soil organic C and functional diversity was negligible, independently of the soil management practices.

Pasture and GB areas included red clover (Trifolium pretense L.) and lespedeza (Kummerowia stipulacea Maxim.) planted into fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) while AgB included Eastern cottonwood trees (Populus deltoids Bortr. ex Marsh.) planted into fescue. One-meter deep soil cores were collected from each treatment in August 2007 and 2008 with a soil probe. Three soil cores were sampled at six replicate sampling positions. Soil cores were collected in plastic tubes inserted inside the metal soil probe. Soils were segregated by horizons, and roots were separated into three diameter classes (0-1, 1-2, > 2 mm) by soil horizon. Root length was determined using a flatbed scanner assisted with computer software. Buffer treatments (167 cm/100 cm(3)) had 4.5 times higher RLD as compared to pasture treatments (37.3 cm/100 cm(3)). The AgB treatment had the highest (173.5 cm/100 cm(3)) RLD and CG pasture had the lowest (10.8 cm/100 cm(3)) value. Root carbon was about 3% higher for the buffers compared to RG treatment. Soil carbon was about 115% higher for the buffers compared to pasture treatments. Results from this study imply that establishment of agroforestry and GB on grazed pasture watersheds improve soil carbon accumulation and root parameters which enhance soil physical and chemical properties thus improving the environmental quality of the landscape."	80	1	41-58		USA	Missouri	39.02	-92.75	Cattle		Riparian strip		Pasture without trees					Total soil carbon		Positive					Kremer2011_1168	Journal Article	2011	"Kremer, Robert J.; Kussman, Robert D."

However, cultivation of annual crops decreases soil organic matter and increases soil erosion potential, especially on sloping landscapes. Perennial crops maintain a continuous soil cover, increase water infiltration, reduce soil erosion, and improve overall soil quality. The objective of this on-farm study was to assess the effects of a perennial legume, kura clover (Trifolium ambiguum M. Bieb.), on soil quality in a recently established pecan (Carya illinoinensis Wangenh. C. Koch) orchard. The pecankura clover agroforestry practice was established on deep loess soils of the Missouri River hills landscape. These silt loams are on 2-20% slopes and can be highly erosive. Kura clover, introduced as the alley crop 5 years after pecan planting, was selected based on its perennial growth habit, nitrogen-fixing ability, winter hardiness, high forage quality, and soil conservation properties. Kura clover was seeded in 2001 and harvested for hay annually beginning 2003. Soil quality indicators of total organic C, total N, water-stable aggregates, and selected soil enzymes were determined on surface soil samples collected annually after kura clover establishment. Soil organic C and activities of soil enzymes increased compared with cultivated and grass pasture control soils by the eighth year of establishment. Water-stable aggregation improved by 50% and surface soil shear strength improved significantly (P < 0.05) in alleys compared with control sites. Results illustrate that kura clover as the alley-cropped component improved soil fertility and biological activity through increased organic matter and improved soil structure, and yielded high quality forage valuable for the cattle-feeding operation. Kura clover maintained or improved soil quality, reduced soil erosion potential, and benefited pecan growth by providing a source of soil nitrogen and improving soil structure for adequate water infiltration and aeration."	83	2	209-pp		USA	Missouri	39.53	-92.98	Pasture without livestock		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees					Soil organic carbon		Positive					Ko1993_1191	Journal Article	1993	"Ko, L.

One savanna and one pasture were paired on loam soils, the other sites were on sandy soils. In general, soil moisture was higher below tree canopies than outside canopies during a drying trend and was similar between areas after a period of rain. Soil organic matter and potassium (K) decreased with increasing distance from tree boles on all sites, while phosphorus (P) showed a similar trend only on the pastures. Pastures had greater soil organic matter and P than savannas of similar soil texture, while the loam soil sites had higher soil pH, organic matter, K, Ca and Mg than sandy sites of similar disturbance history. Areas below canopies received 67% of the ambient rainfall and 27-48% of the ambient photosynthetically active radiation and had 2.3-5.2 C lower soil temperatures compared to areas outside the canopies. Although soil moisture, nutrient and organic matter levels seemed more favorable for plant growth under the canopies, aboveground biomass was lower below canopies compared to open areas at the two savannas, while biomass was equal between canopy and open areas on the one pasture that was measured. This indicates that other factors, such as light, were more important in determining plant biomass. For all sites, plant composition under tree canopies differed from that outside the canopies. Savanna plant species were predominantly perennial and native while pasture species were mostly perennial and exotic. Grazing, fire and previous introductions of prairie species may have been major factors in determining the prevalent species (>5% cover) for a given site. Poa spp. were more prevalent below canopies compared to open areas on all sites, despite their different disturbance histories."	130	1	277-297		USA	Wisconsin	43.06	-89.44	Cattle		Wood pasture		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Negative	Soil organic matter		Positive					Howlett2011_1323	Journal Article	2011	"Howlett, David S.; Rosa Mosquera-Losada, M.; Nair, P.

Soils under birch at 0 to 25 cm stored more C in the 250- to 2000-mu m size class as compared with those under radiata pine; at that depth, pasture had more C than pine silvopasture in the smaller soil fractions (< 53 and 53-250 mu m). In the 75- to 100-cm depth, there was significantly more storage of C in the 250- to 2000-mu m fraction in both silvopastures as compared with the pasture.

Despite strong links between edaphic conditions and riparian zone function, limited research has tested how soil properties respond to restoration, especially in an experimental context. With this important knowledge gap in mind, we established a field experiment to asssess structural vegetation and soil responses in the eight years following livestock exclusion and replanting in lowland streams in south-eastern Australia. On three streams, paired restored and control sites were experimentally established and we monitored vegetation (stem density, cover of bare ground and tree canopy, and loadings of organic matter), once beforehand, and then biennually after restoration. Selected soil properties (total carbon, total nitrogen, plant-available phosphorus) were sampled once shortly after restoration, then after another five years. Significant changes in structural vegetation occurred (e.g. decreased bare ground, increased plant stem density, organic matter, and canopy cover). In contrast, those soil properties did not respond. A mega-drought occurred throughout much of the study which was immediately followed by severe flooding. The floods redistributed organic matter at our study sites, with this effect mediated by vegetation structure: the probability of organic matter retention was positively correlated with groundcover and stem density of plants. The timing of flooding was also correlated with increased soil carbon and nitrogen, which could be due to increased productivity in these systems (for the former), or potentially due to increased fertiliser inputs or increased fixation (for the latter). Our study is the first to comprehensively and experimentally test how vegetation, litter layer and surface soil properties respond following riparian restoration, and will help guide the development and implementation of other monitoring programmes."	252		71-pp		Australia		-36.21	143.84	Sheep		Riparian strip		Baseline from implementation					Soil organic carbon		No effect		Positive			Guevara-Escobar2002_1452	Journal Article	2002	"Guevara-Escobar, A.; Kemp, P.

Four sites were examined, 3 unreplicated sites with mature poplars (>29 years, 37-40 stems/ha) and a replicated experiment with immature poplars (5 years, 50-100 stems/ha). Pastures at all sites were dominated by low fertility species and were grazed by sheep and cattle. Pasture species were used in a glasshouse experiment to assess the production potential of the topsoil media (0-20 mm) from the PP and OP soils, and the OP topsoil amended with 5% poplar leaf litter. Soil pH was higher (0.5-1.2 units) in the PP than the OP at all depths, as were exchangeable cations. After 2 months incubation, OP topsoil amended with 5% leaf litter had higher soil pH than the PP or the OP topsoil. Organic C, total N, P or S, and plant-available P or S were similar in the PP and OP soils, or lower in the PP soil. Soil hydraulic characteristics, macroporosity, water aggregate stability, and bulk density were also similar in the PP and OP areas. The differences in the earthworm numbers and mass between the PP and OP areas were inconsistent. Pasture grown in the PP topsoil produced more over 11 months than treatments containing OP topsoil. In addition to increasing the stability and, hence, sustainability of hill soils at risk from erosion, poplar trees enhanced several other key attributes of the soil. The study suggested that poplars have a restoration role by accelerating soil development following the loss of topsoil from an erosion event."	40	5	592-592		New Zealand		-40.09	175.89	Mixture of sheep and cattle		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees					Soil organic carbon		No effect	No effect				Grange2010_1474	Journal Article	2010	"Grange, I.; Rawson, A."

Specifically, soil organic carbon (SOC) and bulk density (BD) were measured in order to calculate carbon density (CD), used for C accounting purposes. To achieve the same levels of accuracy in estimating the mean for SOC, substantially more samples were required in the highly variable woodland surface soils, whereas sub-surface numbers were more comparable between woodland versus pasture. Woodland soil BD was generally more variable than pasture, this being reflected in the need for larger sample numbers. The SOC variability was in part related to arbitrary demarcation between the soil component and other input sources of C such as the litter and CWD layers. This emphasized the importance of delineation between C pools in an effort to reduce measurement errors. This paper examines some of the issues related to these C pools and the problems of obtaining accurate C estimations."			142-148	accuracy; biomass; bulk density; carbon; ecosystems; grassland soils; grasslands; organic carbon; pastures; sampling; soil organic matter; soil types; spatial variation; woodland grasslands; woodland soils	Australia	New South Wales	-32.08	146.26	Unclear		Wood pasture		Pasture without trees					Total carbon		Positive					Graham2004_1477	Journal Article	2004	"Graham, S.; Wilson, B.

Mineral soils were analysed for pH ( CaCl2), organic carbon ( C), and extractable phosphorus ( P) concentration, while for the litter samples, P, sulfur, cations, and ash alkalinity were determined. Stocking with sheep and cattle increased surface soil acidity and C and P concentrations at each location. However, soils under E. melliodora and E. viminalis showed higher pH and increased C and P concentrations close to the tree stem irrespective of grazing. Soils under E. caliginosa, while having similar patterns of C and P, showed variable acidity patterns with instances of lower pH close to the tree stem. Spatial patterns in soil acidity were associated with the ash alkalinity of litter, indicating litter as a source of alkalinity addition to the soil surface, although different patterns of soil pH could not be fully explained by litter ash alkalinity alone. The close correlation of litter Ca content with ash alkalinity suggests that this element might be a suitable indicator of the acid amelioration capacity of different tree species."	42	8	339-348		Australia	New South Wales	-30.51	151.66	Mixture of sheep and cattle		Wood pasture	Sparse paddock trees	Other	Pasture without grazing				Soil organic carbon		Positive					Gonzalez-Roglich2014_1488	Journal Article	2014	"Gonzalez-Roglich, Mariano; Swenson, Jennifer J.; Jobbagy, Esteban G.; Jackson, Robert B."

Increases in woody plant cover alter the distribution of carbon in the ecosystem and can affect water and nutrient cycling. Although semiarid rangelands comprise almost half of the global land surface, our understanding on the effects of woody plant encroachment on carbon stocks in these ecosystems is uncertain - studies have found both net C gains and losses. We measured, for the first time in South American semiarid savannas, ecosystem C stocks along a gradient of woody plant density across 30,000 km(2) of the Caldenal in central Argentina. We characterized changes in C stocks in live biomass (woody and herbaceous, above- and belowground), litter, and soil organic carbon (to 1.5 m depth) pools along a woody plant cover gradient (0-94%). We found a significant increase in ecosystem C stocks with increasing woody cover, with mean values of 4.5, 8.4, 12.4, and 16.5 kg C m(-2) for grasslands, shrublands, open and closed forests, respectively. Using dendrochronological data we estimated the average C accrual rate to be 104 g C m(-2) yr(-1) at the ecosystem (plant + soil) level. Woody plant cover and soil silt content were the two primary factors accounting for the variability of ecosystem C. We developed simple regression models that reliably predict soil, tree and ecosystem C stocks from basic field measurements of woody plant cover and soil silt content. These models could prove to be valuable tools for broad scale estimation if linked to regional soil maps and remotely sensed data, allowing for precise and spatially explicit estimation of C stocks and change at regional scales.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of scattered cork oak trees (Quercus suber L.) on soil quality, considering two land use systems: unmanaged pastures and improved pastures. Soil samples were collected in a square grid around scattered cork oak trees to evaluate the spatial variability of soil bulk density and chemical properties. In soil samples taken beneath tree canopy and in the open, net N mineralization was evaluated by aerobic incubations. Also, laboratory incubations were carried out to evaluate the effect of roots (tree or/and herbaceous) and water solutions (bulk precipitation, throughfall or stemflow) on net N mineralization.Contents of organic C, total N and extractable P were increased beneath the tree canopy, and gradually decreased with the increase of distance to the tree trunk. Improved pastures established 26 years ago increased organic C (0.76 kg m-2), total N (0.06 kg m-2) and extractable P (2.70 g m-2) amounts in the 0-10 cm soil layer beneath the tree canopy relatively to those of unmanaged pastures. Net N mineralization was significantly greater (about 2 times) in soils beneath the tree canopy than in those of open areas. N mineralization was unaffected by addition of throughfall or stemflow, while a significant reduction resulted from tree roots addition, this effect being stronger for herbaceous plant roots than for tree roots.

This study was undertaken to measure the size of C stocks in three predominant ecosystems: Pinus ponderosa-based silvopastoral systems (SPS), pine plantations (PPP) and natural pasture (PST), and examine how clover affect tree growth and stocks of soil C. The C contents of trees and pasture were determined by destructive sampling and dry combustion. Soil samples were taken at 0-5, 5-20, 20-40 cm depths in order to determine soil C and N. For PPP and SPS total aboveground tree C was 38.4 and 53.1 kg tree(-1) and belowground was 21.3 and 23.4 kg tree(-1), respectively. Annual diameter increment at breast height was 1 and 2 cm in PPP and SPS, respectively, and was significantly higher in SPS. Trees in SPS, due to lower density and the presence of leguminous pasture, demonstrated enhanced growth and C sequestration.

Ruminant livestock production generates more greenhouse gas emissions than other types of agricultural production and most livestock mitigation options to date have a modest greenhouse gas reduction potential (<20%). Trees and soils, by comparison, can sequester large amounts of carbon depending on the availability of land. Previous studies on carbon neutral livestock production have shown that farms with a stocking rate of 8 dry sheep equivalents (DSE)/ha can be carbon neutral or carbon positive by sequestering more carbon than is emitted from the farm. However, the carbon offsets required by farms with higher stocking rates (>20 DSE/ha) has yet to be studied in Australia. The challenge is to sequester enough carbon to offset the higher level of emissions that these higher stocked farms produce. This study calculated the carbon balance of wool, prime lamb and beef enterprises using a range of stocking rates (6-22 DSE/ha) and levels of tree cover in two agroecological zones. Emissions from livestock, energy and transport were offset by the carbon sequestered in trees and soils. Additionally, the carbon balance was calculated of a case study, Jigsaw Farms, an intensive sheep and beef farm in south-eastern Australia. The methods used to calculate emissions and carbon stocks were from the Australian National Greenhouse Gas Inventory. The majority of stocking rates were carbon positive over a 25-year period when 20% of the sheep or beef enterprises were covered with trees. This study demonstrated that substantial reductions can be made in greenhouse gas emissions through the use of carbon sequestration, particularly in trees. The results showed that from 2000 to 2014 Jigsaw Farms reduced its emissions by 48% by sequestering carbon in trees and soil. The analysis of different stocking rates and tree cover provides an important reference point for farmers, researchers and policy analysts to estimate the carbon balance of wool, prime lamb and beef enterprises based on stocking rate and the area of tree cover."	58	9	61-72		Australia	Victoria	-37.6	141.84	Sheep		Farm woodland		Baseline from implementation					Livestock offset/mitigation		Positive					Doran-Browne2016_1786	Journal Article	2016	"Doran-Browne, Natalie A.; Ive, John; Graham, Phillip; Eckard, Richard J."

Therefore, it is desirable to reduce or offset those emissions where possible. Although mitigation options exist that reduce ruminant GHGE through the use of feed management, flock structure or breeding management, these options only reduce the existing emissions by up to 30% whereas planting trees and subsequent carbon sequestration in trees and soil has the potential for livestock emissions to be offset in their entirety. Trees can introduce additional co-benefits that may increase production such as reduced salinity and therefore increased pasture production, shelter for animals or reduced erosion. Trees will also use more water and compete with pastures for water and light. Therefore, careful planning is required to locate trees where the co-benefits can be maximised instead of any negative trade-offs. This study analysed the carbon balance of a wool case study farm, Talaheni, in south-eastern Australia to determine if the farm was carbon neutral. The Australian National Greenhouse Gas Inventory was used to calculate GHGE and carbon stocks, with national emissions factors used where available, and otherwise figures from the IPCC methodology being used. Sources of GHGE were from livestock, energy and fuel, and carbon stocks were present in the trees and soil. The results showed that from when the farm was purchased in 1980-2012 the farm had sequestered 11 times more carbon dioxide equivalents (CO(2)e) in trees and soil than was produced by livestock and energy. Between 1980 and 2012 a total of 31100 t CO(2)e were sequestered with 19300 and 11800 t CO(2)e in trees and soil, respectively, whereas farm emissions totalled 2800 t CO(2)e. There was a sufficient increase in soil carbon stocks alone to offset all GHGE at the study site. This study demonstrated that there are substantial gains to be made in soil carbon stocks where initial soils are eroded and degraded and there is the opportunity to increase soil carbon either through planting trees or introducing perennial pastures to store more carbon under pastures. Further research would be beneficial on the carbon-neutral potential of farms in more fertile, high-rainfall areas. These areas typically have higher stocking rates than the present study and would require higher levels of carbon stocks for the farm to be carbon neutral."	56	02-Mar	84-9		Australia		-34.98	149.14	Mixture of sheep and cattle		Farm woodland		Baseline from implementation					Livestock offset/mitigation		Positive					Dahlgren1997_1877	Journal Article	1997	"Dahlgren, R.

This study examines the effects of oak trees and low to moderate intensity grazing on soil properties and nutrient pools in a blue oak (Quercus douglasii H.&A.) woodland in the Sierra Nevada foothills of northern California. Four combinations of vegetation and management were investigated: oak with grazing, oak without grazing, open grasslands with grazing, and open grasslands without grazing. Results indicate that oak trees create islands of enhanced fertility through organic matter incorporation and nutrient cycling. Compared to adjacent grasslands, soils beneath the oak canopy have a lower bulk density, higher pH, and greater concentrations of organic carbon, nitrogen, total and available P, and exchangeable Ca, Mg, and K, especially in the upper soil horizons (0-35 cm). In contrast, the light grazing utilized at this site had minimal effects on soil properties which included an increase in the bulk density of the surface horizon and an increase in available P throughout the entire soil profile. While low to moderate intensity grazing has little effect at this study site, there could be much larger impacts under the more intensive grazing practices utilized on many rangelands. The lack of oak regeneration and oak tree removal to enhance forage production may eventually lead to large losses of nutrients and soil fertility from these ecosystems. Results of this study have important implications for predicting how management practices may potentially affect oak regeneration, water quality, and ecosystem sustainability."	39	1	155-169		USA	California 	39.25	-121.31	Cattle		Forest grazing		Forest without grazing	Pasture without trees				Soil organic carbon		Positive	Negative			Negative	Coelho2012_1956	Journal Article	2012	"Coelho, Marta Baptista; Paulo, Joana Amaral; Nunes Palma, Joao Henrique; Tome, Margarida"	Contribution of cork oak plantations installed after 1990 in Portugal to the Kyoto commitments and to the landowners economy	Forest Policy and Economics	1389-9341	10.1016/j.forpol.2011.10.005	<Go to ISI>://WOS:000302986600009; https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/272157/1-s2.0-S1389934112X00030/1-s2.0-S1389934111001845/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEAIaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIQC8qc3LNGmDeDT83miYg1tRVNrx%2F2B3FlR%2FkgpgkUIY0QIgMcSQj2A%2F4ivItqyZXN4JFyuUlYM%2BU1kLkgETljpegi0qvQMIuv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARACGgwwNTkwMDM1NDY4NjUiDPFxRCgr9lZttKK4MiqRA3rvdJ0iteFh%2BjksRqlnNnR9Kz2MwSNiRd%2B5PRAWq9qJCvm%2FywWUDqUNhx%2F9hU1SQOiC9GPYqrAlxDInHoz29UwYqK3nGGrM9itrtJiTmwmJATWMjbeUSiOqbHtWEqxIkFLmev6%2FUGCHgbTFbk80fkippB0FfhJLVym4ot4ke4tQ52BrsGGiHroOiJxhDqUCYZidDUWhe%2BihO8usXefDckkXKm4YC3PIZfFRY5eOHEMjSH7902hqmKpmK0xhki7IyM18yS957mUHjy05U2YwL3pEHFFntm0EtOY2dipYOoy0LH35mzq1LxgMbyaPx1ArRjiXGWSiSGqKoeJjDKi5He2R2syLN1G%2FelHQnm0OF6IlpLmxiECqD3ll%2Bcx74jVdSGulLr7VJ%2BBs6aJtoALIpwz7H8tC1W19YP3BHvq1F%2FfQYjHwSlCxUBbrh2toEt1ngmrAp0Ef9FV9WVgEzTZovISChTMNM1b237K5l%2BeR6eZc7CJ2XTXlMsvFaxaJMwb0NQMCrQwg9Cdwsd0CFhPfeMNDMMa1qfIFOusBf85ZL%2FDTY0ol3ZrAAPyTvjuvaeBBK2H4%2FkqVBidn1vyciIWj0RbMXnZn1VFlITHXYhOCBF9N2b0Jk1xL%2BsBwq5kaMf0oDjfoY0HTl%2BhmuEGAQf%2FBaYeaZ7ul%2BBR4zndMl%2BN1sWW2HyGcmI4%2BdRZSpdPSpcCEyfb3Zo092bfaegIqF5hBp4JBfJllVYyBFGF7c%2FiJ9bfxBfpSfOMaY34gJI4rP3f9Ba34F%2FUWKpwLv50CxHuhfZJzVxawsRhcAPisDGk69TruTaRB%2BCTwAwWCtzk4ofwZgXoc8Aq1eP36OhB0%2BvPzgNGErwFNCg%3D%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20200217T100427Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTY44ZQJADJ%2F20200217%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=7103cd2d2f13a4a1c2baf6ebd93c2aca48ef184353d24c684b5b93af0497608a&hash=250af36226729072d20aead5adcf338ce46b163e9f184596b596f1b0c30d1b9c&host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&pii=S1389934111001845&tid=spdf-cb597918-8177-4b17-8c90-2667580ca613&sid=6600d5da1884e6475a2a85b800c96bdc5469gxrqb&type=client	"Cork oak stands are a part of the agroforestry ecosystem in Portugal, characterized by a low crown cover from cork oak trees, managed towards cork production, and sometimes in combination with grazing. In recent years, European Union policies gave impetus to a large area of new cork oak plantations, which have been established mainly for cork production purposes, and consequently with higher stand density than traditional agroforestry systems. These plantations are important not only for cork production but also for the carbon sequestered by these slow growing forests that won't be harvested for wood production. Thinning operations will be needed to avoid excessive inter-tree competition and wood extracted from these thinning may also provide income for the owners. In the present study, carbon sequestered and wood volumes resulting from thinning were estimated for the next 70 years. Three scenarios of different annual afforestation rates and different site indexes were tested. The resulting values for the considered scenarios show that, if the plantation rates are maintained, new cork oak plantations will have an important contribution to the Portuguese commitments to providing CO2 offsets under the Kyoto protocol. Additionally, due to the increasing values of initial density in new cork plantations, cork oak forests will produce a significant volume of wood that may become an important contribution to the landowners' income.

It is well established that reforestation can have a profound impact on soil physicochemical properties but the associated changes to soil microbial communities are poorly understood. Therefore, the objective of this study was to quantify changes in soil physicochemical properties and microbial communities in soils collected from reforested pastures and compare then to remnant vegetation and un-reforested pastures. To address this aim, we collected soil from two locations (pasture and its adjacent reforested zone, or pasture and its adjacent remnant vegetation) on each of ten separate farms that covered the range of planting ages (0-30 years and remnant vegetation) in a temperate region of southeastern Australia. Soils were analysed for a range of physicochemical properties (including C and nutrients), and microbial biomass and community composition (PLFA profiles). Soil C:N ratios increased with age of tree planting, and soil C concentration was highest in the remnant woodlands. Reforestation had no clear impact on soil microbial biomass or fungal:bacterial ratios (based on PLFA's). Reforestation was associated with significant changes in the molecular composition of the soil microbial community at many farms but similar changes were found within a pasture. These results indicate that reforestation of pastures can result in changes in soil properties within a few decades, but that soil microbial community composition can vary as much spatially within pastures as it does after reforestation.

In silvoarable systems, trees are intercropped with arable crops, and in silvopastoral systems trees are combined with pasture for livestock. These systems may produce forage and timber as well as providing ecosystem services such as climate change mitigation. Carbon (C) is stored in the aboveground and belowground biomass of the trees, and the transfer of organic matter from the trees to the soil can increase soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. Few studies have assessed the impact of agroforestry systems on carbon storage in soils in temperate climates, as most have been undertaken in tropical regions. This study assessed five silvoarable systems and one silvopastoral system in France. All sites had an agroforestry system with an adjacent, purely agricultural control plot. The land use management in the inter-rows in the agroforestry systems and in the control plots were identical. The age of the study sites ranged from 6 to 41 years after tree planting. Depending on the type of soil, the sampling depth ranged from 20 to 100 cm and SOC stocks were assessed using equivalent soil masses. The aboveground biomass of the trees was also measured at all sites. In the silvoarable systems, the mean organic carbon stock accumulation rate in the soil was 0.24 (0.09-0.46) Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) at a depth of 30 cm and 0.65 (0.004-1.85) Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in the tree biomass. Increased SOC stocks were also found in deeper soil layers at two silvoarable sites. Young plantations stored additional SOC but mainly in the soil under the rows of trees, possibly as a result of the herbaceous vegetation growing in the rows.

GHG emissions per kilogram meat in the economic optimum differ between the production systems and range from 18 to 21.9 kg CO2-eq./kg meat. Only GHG offset by agroforestry systems showed the potential to significantly reduce these emissions. Depending on the production system agroforestry systems could reduce net GHG emissions by 66% to 7.3 kg CO2-eq./kg meat in the most intensive system and by 100% in the most extensive system. In this calculation a carbon sequestration rate of 8 t CO2/ha/year was assumed. The potential of a combination of the addition of lipids to the diet, a cover of the slurry tank and the application of nitrification inhibitors only had the potential to reduce GHG emissions by 12% thereby marginal abatement costs are increasing much faster than for agroforestry systems. A reduction of the GHG emissions to 7.5 kg CO2-eq./kg meat-possible with agroforestry only-raised costs between 0.03 CHF/kg meat and 0.38 CHF/kg meat depending on the production system and the state of the system before the reduction. If GHG emissions were reduced maximally average costs ranged between 0.37 CHF/kg meat, if agroforestry had the potential to reduce net GHG emissions to 0 kg CO2-eq., to 1.17 CHF/kg meat if also other options had to be applied."	17	4	1130-&		Switzerland		46.94	7.51	Cattle		Silvopasture		Baseline from implementation		Livestock growth		Positive	Livestock offset/mitigation		Positive					PositiveBerhongaray2013_2210	Journal Article	2013	"Berhongaray, G.; Alvarez, R.; Paepe, J. de; Caride, C.; Cantet, R."

Eighty two farms, widespread over the region, were used for the study. At each farm paired treatments were sampled representing common land uses: trees, uncropped controls, seeded pastures, cropped fields and periodically flooded areas. Bulk density, SOC, SIC, texture, pH and electrical conductivity were determined to 1 m depth. Rainfall and temperature were obtained from climatic records. Significant differences were detected between treatments in SOC contents. Average SOC stocks to 1 m were: 131 t ha-1 under trees >101 t ha-1 in uncropped control >90 t ha-1 in pastures=86 t ha-1 in cropped field > and 70 t ha-1 in flooded sites. Compared with uncropped controls, SOC was significantly different in all soil layers under trees, to 75 cm depth in flooded sites and to 50 cm in pastures and cropped soils. Agriculture determined a reduction of 16% of SOC to 50 cm in sampled sites. In the 50-100 cm depth a decrease of 9% was observed, though not significant. The stratification pattern of SOC in depth was not affected by the treatments; implying that land use impacted the SOC sequestered in soil, but not its allocation in depth. SIC accounted for one third of total soil carbon, average SIC stock was 50 t C ha-1 to 1 m. Both, its stock and distribution in the profile were not affected by the treatments; with greater SIC stocks founded in deep soil layers. An artificial neural network model was developed that allowed the estimation of SOC (R2=0.64) based on climate, soil properties and land use. The model, linked to information from satellite image classification, was used for the estimation of present SOC stock of pampean soils, which accounted for 4.22+or-0.14 Gt in an area of 48.2 Mha. Using soil surveys performed during the 1960-1980 period we estimated a SOC stock of 3.96+or-0.22 Gt. Consequently, no change of total SOC stock seems to be produced in the last decades in the region. At smaller scale, counties with SOC content greater than 95 t ha-1 to 1 m depth lost carbon; increases prevailed below this threshold. Apparently, SIC reservoirs seem have not change during the last decades."	192		6-10	bulk density; carbon; carbon sequestration; classification; climate; conductivity; density; electrical conductivity; farms; land use; models; organic carbon; pastures; properties; rain; reservoirs; satellite imagery; soil; soil chemistry; soil organic matter; soil properties; soil surveys; stratification; surveys; temperature; treatment; trees; variation; woody plants	Argentina	Pampas	-37.08	-65.42	Unclear		Farm woodland		Pasture without trees					Soil organic carbon		Positive					Beckert2016_2233	Journal Article	2016	"Beckert, Marvin R.; Smith, Pete; Lilly, Allan; Chapman, Stephen J."

Woodland establishment in upland grasslands can be a carbon sink, but soil carbon losses have also been observed. Dedicated woodland plots and silvopasture are two contrasting strategies to achieve increased carbon stocks. We compared the carbon sequestration potential of the two approaches with three tree species (Hybrid Larch, Scots Pine and Sycamore) planted on permanent pasture on an upland farm in North East Scotland, 24 years after planting. Soil organic carbon was measured in the A (similar to 0-30 cm) and B (similar to 30-50) horizons. The soil carbon was also fractionated into labile, protected and resistant pools. Litter layers were measured and tree biomass carbon was estimated using allometric equations. We found that total soil carbon stocks (A plus B horizon) were similar and did not differ significantly between treatments, but for both coniferous species silvopasture tended to have the greater soil carbon stock followed by woodland, whereas Sycamore had the greater stock in the woodland treatment; pasture had the least carbon stock. Woodland stored more carbon in the labile fractions and litter layer than both pasture and silvopasture of all treatments, which had similar levels of stabilized carbon. Biomass per tree was significantly greater in the silvopasture treatments for all species, but on a per hectare basis woodland stored significantly more carbon. Land management comparison shows that large proportions of grassland would need to be converted to woodland to provide similar carbon benefits as the integrative silvopastoral system."	90	3	927-983		UK	Scotland	57.087445	-2.094315	Mixture of sheep and cattle		Silvopasture		Baseline from implementation					Soil organic carbon		Positive					Bangura2015_2261	Journal Article	2015	"Bangura, A.; Oo, Y.

The samples were collected in the spring (September 2011) and autumn (March 2012) at increasing distance from the midpoint of shelterbelts. To determine the SOC level in the sample, two permanganate oxidisable methods were used: the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and labile carbon analysis method. Regression analysis of our result indicated no significant difference (P>0.005) in SOC along the sampling points in an increasing distance from the midpoint of the shelterbelts in both seasons. However, there was a significant difference (P<0.005) in SOC level between the two depths. During autumn at 0.00-0.10 m depth the TOC was higher at Weston 1 (1.386%) than College 4 and Leeds Parade site with 1.146% and 1.11% respectively. For the same depth, Weston 1 had 0.061% labile C and 0.054% labile C for both College 4 and Leeds Parade sites. This may be attributed to the topographic difference among the sites. SOC was higher during autumn sampling than spring sampling in all three sites and at both depths due to microbial activity, higher vegetation and warmer climate in autumn."	7	1	97-110	autumn; carbon sequestration; land management; microbial activities; organic carbon; pastures; shelterbelts; soil depth; soil organic matter; spring	Australia	New South Wales	-33.15	149.07	Unclear		Shelterbelt/Windbreak		Pasture without trees					Soil organic carbon		No effect					Baah-Acheamfour2015_2285	Journal Article	2015	"Baah-Acheamfour, Mark; Chang, Scott X.; Carlyle, Cameron N.; Bork, Edward W."

We studied the impact of component land cover types (forested vs. adjacent herbland) in three agroforestry systems (hedgerow, shelterbelt and silvopasture) on organic C and nitrogen (N) distribution in three density fractions of soils at the 0-10 and 10-30 cm layers. The study evaluated 36 sites (12 hedgerows, 12 shelterbelts and 12 silvopastures) in central Alberta, Canada, distributed along a soil/climate gradient of increasing moisture availability. At the 0-10 cm layer, soil organic C (SOC) stock in the bulk soil was significantly greater in the silvopasture system (101) than in either the hedgerow (77) or shelterbelt system (67 Mg C ha(-1)). Soil organic C stock in both soil layers (0-10 and 10-30 cm) was also significantly greater in the forested land cover (89 and 119 Mg C ha(-1), respectively) than in adjacent herblands (76 and 77 Mg C ha(-1)). Across all sites, 31.5, 29.1, and 35.5% of SOC was found in the light fraction (<1.6 g cm(-3)), occluded fraction (ultrasonic dispersion at 360W for 5 min, <1.6 g cm(-3)), and heavy fraction (>1.6g cm(-3)) of soils, respectively. The largest pool of SOC in the more labile light fraction of the 0-10 cm layer was in the silvopasture system (50 Mg C ha(-1)), whereas the smallest labile light fraction component of SOC was in the shelterbelt system (17 Mg C ha(-1)). The largest pool of SOC in the more stable heavy fraction of both the 0-10 and 10-30 cm depth classes was in the shelterbelt (33 and 35 Mg C ha(-1), respectively), while the least SOC was in the silvopasture system (26 and 20 Mg C ha(-1), respectively). We conclude that the presence of Populus based silvopasture system can increase C storage in surface mineral soils, and that the establishment of Picea based shelterbelts in an otherwise annually cropped agricultural landscape enhances the size of the stable SOC pool.

Effect of grazing on carbon sequestration and tree growth that is developed in a silvopastoral system under wild cherry (Prunus avium L.)	Catena				"Silvopastoral systems have been considered a good tool for carbon sequestration by taking up atmospheric carbon dioxide and storing it in the soil. The effect of animal presence on carbon sequestration in this type of agroforestry system has been studied recently. However, the soil carbon storage in these systems is influenced by the stocking rate. In addition, soil fractions have been known to influence carbon storage. This study was undertaken in order to examine the effects of livestock grazing at two different stocking rates [Light Stocking Rate (LS; 4 sheep ha_ 1) and Heavy Stocking Rate (HS; 8 sheep ha_ 1)]. This was compared with the soil chemical and physical properties of No Grazing (NG) pastures, the amount of C stored in the whole soil, in three different soil fractions (250?000, 53?50, and b 53 _m), at each of four soil depths (0?5, 25?0, 50?5, and 75?00 cm), and the tree growth in a silvopastoral system under Prunus avium L. The presence of animals in silvopastoral systems plays an important role in carbon sequestration by the direct or indirect modifications of the pH, the soil bulk density, and the soil fraction proportions. The LS treatment promoted carbon sequestration linked to macroaggregates in the upper soil layers when compared with the HS treatment and the NG treatment. However, in deep horizons, the NG treatment enhanced the soil organic carbon storage more than did the grazing treat- ments and this carbon was linked to microaggregates, increasing the soil density.
