Total phosphorus concentrations and compaction in riparian areas under different riparian land-uses of Iowa	Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment	0167-8809	10.1016/j.agee.2008.02.008	<Go to ISI>://WOS:000257528100003	"Reducing non-point source phosphorus (P) pollution is often necessary to improve water quality in agricultural streams. Soil total P (TP) concentrations and compaction are soil characteristics that can influence P losses to streams. The objective of this study was to compare these two soil characteristics among riparian forest buffers, grass filters, pastures with cattle fenced out of the stream, intensive rotational, rotational and continuously grazed pastures and row-cropped fields in three physiographic regions of Iowa. Soil TP and compaction for the seven riparian land-uses were determined in stream bank and surface riparian soils. Total P concentrations in stream bed material along the seven riparian land-uses were also measured. Total P concentrations in riparian stream bank soils among land-uses ranged from 303 to 398 mg kg(-1) in the central region, to 432-518 mg kg(-1) in the northeast, to 360-555 mg kg(-1) in the southeast. In the surface riparian soils TIP among land-uses ranged from 434 to 649 mg kg(-1) in the central region, to 493-764 mg kg(-1) in the northeast region, to 428-716 mg kg(-1) in the southeast region. Finally, the TP concentrations in the stream bed sediments among land-uses ranged 194-307 mg kg(-1) in the central region, to 169-461 mg kg(-1) in the northeast, to 389-964 mg kg(-1) in the southeast. Few soil TP significant differences among riparian land-uses within regions were found. Soil compaction under some of the grazing practices was significantly higher than under the conservation practices. Limited differences in soil TP concentrations and compaction were partially due to the young age of the conservation practices and the rotational and intensive rotational pastures. Past land-use on these sites had been either continuous grazing or row-cropping and those uses were still influencing these soil parameters. Within riparian land-uses, surface riparian soils generally had higher TP than the stream bank riparian soils. Stream bed samples had lower TP concentrations than the riparian soils in the northeast and central regions but were higher than the riparian soils in some of the land-uses in the southeast region. Overall TP concentrations in the stream bank, surface riparian soils and stream bed material were high indicating that these areas can potentially be important source areas of P and the focus should be on reducing the transport of P.

Streambank erosion can contribute a significant percentage of the phosphorus and sediment load in streams. Riparian land-uses can heavily influence streambank erosion. The objective of this study was to compare streambank erosion along reaches of row-cropped fields, continuous, rotational and intensive rotational grazed pastures, pastures where cattle were fenced out of the stream, grass filters and riparian forest buffers, in three physiographic regions of Iowa. Streambank erosion was measured by surveying the extent of severely eroding banks within each riparian land-use reach and randomly establishing pin plots on subsets of those eroding banks. Based on these measurements, streambank erosion rate, erosion activity, maximum pin plot erosion rate, percentage of streambank length with severely eroding banks, and soil and phosphorus losses per unit length of stream reach were compared among the riparian land-uses. Riparian forest buffers had the lowest streambank erosion rate (15-46 mm/year) and contributed the least soil (5-18 tonne/km/year) and phosphorus (26 kg/km/year) to stream channels. Riparian forest buffers were followed by grass filters (erosion rates 41106 mm/year, soil losses 22-47 tonne/km/year, phosphorus losses 9-14 kg/km/year) and pastures where cattle were fenced out of the stream (erosion rates 22-58 mm/year, soil losses 6-61 tonne/km/year, phosphorus losses 3-34 kg/km/year). The streambank erosion rates for the continuous, rotational, and intensive rotational pastures were 101-171, 104-122, and 94-170 mm/year, respectively. The soil losses for the continuous, rotational, and intensive rotational pastures were 197-264, 94-266, and 124-153 tonne/km/year, respectively, while the phosphorus losses were 71-123, 37-122, and 66 kg/kmyear, respectively. The only significant differences for these pasture practices were found among the percentage of severely eroding bank lengths with intensive rotational grazed pastures having the least compared to the continuous and rotational grazed pastures.

Large amounts of fines cover the other bed substrate that are essential habitat for invertebrates and fish. In Iowa and other agricultural Midwestern states, riparian conservation land-uses are being established to minimize sediment inputs to streams. This study compared stream bed substrate composition in reaches adjacent to: riparian forest buffers, grass filters, row-cropped fields, pastures with cattle fenced out of the stream and continuous, rotational and intensively grazed rotational pastures, in three regions of Iowa. The objective was to examine the impacts of the adjacent riparian land-uses on stream bed substrate composition. The percentages of fines in this study ranged from: 36 to 63% in the central region; 10 to 31% in the northeast region; and 22 to 85% in the southeast region. The high percentage of fines in most stream bed reaches indicates high embeddedness. The high embeddedness resulted in the few significant differences in substrate percentages among riparian land-uses. Decades of agricultural land-uses have heavily impacted stream beds and only significant reductions in surface and bank erosion at the watershed scale can begin to reverse this trend. There were indications that riparian forest buffers and to a lesser degree, pastures with cattle fenced out of the stream, could decrease fines resulting in a more diverse substrate composition. Overall, more targeted approaches for the establishment of conservation land-uses in combination with other restoration practices (e.g. in-stream enhancements) are required to successfully decrease fines on stream beds.

The objective of this study was to investigate the impacts of riparian land management on gully erosion. A field survey documented the number of gullies and cattle access points in riparian forest buffers, grass filters, annual row-cropped fields, pastures in which the cattle were fenced out of the stream, and continuously, rotationally and intensive rotationally grazed pastures in three regions of Iowa. Gully lengths, depths and severely eroding bank areas were measured. Gullies exhibited few significant differences among riparian management practices. The most significant differences were exhibited between conservation and agricultural management practices, an indication that conservation practices could reduce gully erosion. Changes in pasture management from continuous to rotational or intensive rotational grazing showed no reductions in gully erosion. It is important to recognize that more significant differences among riparian management practices were not exhibited because the conservation and alternative grazing practices had recently been established. As gully formation is more impacted by upland than riparian management, gully stabilization might require additional upland conservation practices. The existence of numerous cattle access points in pastures where cattle have full access to the stream also indicates that these could be substantial sources of sediment for streams. Finally, the gully banks were less important sediment contributors to streams than the streambanks. The severely eroding bank areas in streams were six times greater than those in the gullies in the monitored reaches."	49	5			USA	Iowa	42.0751	Ê-93.496	Cattle		Riparian strip		Pasture without trees											Mixed results (positive and no effect)	Zaimes2015_21	Journal Article	2015	"Zaimes, George N.; Schultz, Richard C."

These factors can be spatial such as bank aspect, height and slope or temporal such as seasonal and yearly precipitation and streamflow events. Riparian land-use also has a major influence, This study investigated for two years, spatial and temporal patterns and dominant geomorphologic processes of stream bank erosion and deposition along a 10 km reach of Bear Creek in north-central Iowa, USA. The channel sub-reaches used were adjacent to a riparian forest buffer, a perennial grass filter and a continuously grazed pasture. Two plots were placed in each sub-reach; one on a north-facing outside bank (north-bank) and the other on a south-facing outside bank (south-bank). Each plot had two photo-electronic erosion pins (PEEPS) placed at 1/3 of the bank height (bottom-bank) and the other at 2/3 of the bank height (top-bank). PEEP daily measurements were compared to daily precipitation and streamflow. The continuously grazed pasture banks had the highest erosion rates. The grass area banks had approximately equal rates of erosion and deposition. The riparian forest buffer banks had high erosion rates during the second year. In the continuously grazed pasture, fluvial entrainment was the dominant erosion process, although minor mass failures also caused erosion. In the riparian forest buffer most erosion was recorded after moderate streamflows removed the bank soil loosened by freeze-thaw cycling. This occurred in late winter/early spring, when trees provide primarily mechanical but not hydraulic reinforcement to stream banks and on the lower part of the banks that have less extensive root networks. Overall, stream bank erosion and deposition in each sub-reach occurred during different time periods and under different processes and conditions. This indicates the need for continuous erosion and deposition measurements along with continuous soil moisture, soil temperature and streamflow measurements to fully comprehend these erosion phenomena.

Analysis of dry matter yields in the third year	Agroforestry Systems	0167-4366	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00711572		"Dry matter yield (DM), and water use and light interception, were determined in an agroforestry trial near Lincoln, New Zealand, consisting of Pinus radiata grown over (1) control (bare ground), (2) ryegrass/clovers (Lolium perenne/Trifolium spp.), (3) ryegrass only, and (4) lucerne (Medicago sativa), during the third growing season between 1992 and 1993. In addition these pastures were grown alone in separate plots in the open. Pasture yields during the one-year period in the agroforestry plots were little affected by the presence of trees although there were seasonal trends: yields were generally unaffected or increased in summer, but reduced in spring as a result of tree shade. Total pasture yield during the one-year period was in the following order: lucerne > ryegrass/clover > ryegrass. This trend was the exact opposite of that shown by the above-ground tree weight which was reduced in the pasture ground covers by 16-52%. The reduction in tree weights was associated with reduced soil moisture availability arising from competition with the pasture species. Thus the relationship between the yields of trees and pasture species in the agroforestry plot was reciprocal. The combined DM for both the trees and pastures in the agroforestry plots during the one-year period was in the following order: lucerne (20 t/ha) > ryegrass/clover (16 t) > ryegrass (11 t) > control (6 t). These results are consistent with the total water used and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) intercepted. The trees accounted for 55, 44, 34 and 24% of water used respectively in control, ryegrass, ryegrass/clover and lucerne ground covers. The balance was largely accounted for by pasture transpiration, except in the control where soil evaporation was significant. The fraction of intercepted PAR accounted for by the trees followed a similar trend to that of the water used. The crop coefficient for water use efficiency (k) (Pa) was 2.3 for radiata pine, 3.6 for ryegrass/clover, 2.8 for ryegrass and 4.8 for lucerne. The DM produced per unit of water used (kg mm-1 ha-1) during the one-year period was 24.5 for radiata pine, 41.1 for lucerne, 30.0 for ryegrass/clovers and 23.1 for ryegrass. Radiation use efficiency (g DM MJ-1 m-2) was 1.33 for pine, 1.83 for ryegrass/clover, 1.49 for ryegrass and 2.34 for lucerne. The land equivalent ratio (LER, the sum of ratios of DM produced by the plant species in the agroforestry plots to those produced in the sole plots) was 1.95 for ryegrass, 1.71 for ryegrass/clover and 1.46 for lucerne. These results indicate the susceptibility of the pasture species to shading and interception of rainfall by the tree crowns (aboveground interactions), and of the trees to competition for soil moisture (underground interaction)."	32	2		agroforestry; agroforestry systems; biomass production; dry matter; farming systems; ground cover; interception; light; light penetration; lucerne; pastures; pines; plant competition; plant water relations; silvopastoral systems; soil water; transpiration; trees; use efficiency; water potential; water use; water use efficiency; woody plants; yields	New Zealand	South Island	-43.65	172.49	Pasture without livestock		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		No effect								Yeates2000_32	Journal Article	2000	"Yeates, G.

Livestock grazing was associated with a decline in native perennial cover and an increase in exotic annual cover, reduced litter cover, reduced soil cryptogam cover, loss of surface soil microtopography, increased erosion, changes in the concentrations of soil nutrients, degradation of surface soil structure, reduced soil water infiltration rates and changes in near ground and soil microclimate. The results suggest that livestock grazing changes woodland conditions and disrupts the resource regulatory processes that maintain the natural biological array in E. salmonophloia woodlands. Consequently the conditions and resources in many remnant woodlands may be above or below critical thresholds for many species. The implications of these findings for restoration of plant species diversity and community structure are discussed. Simply removing livestock from degraded woodlands is unlikely to result in the restoration of plant species diversity and community structure. Restoration will require strategies that capture resources, increase their retention and improve microclimate."	25	1			Australia		-25.274398	133.775136	Sheep		Forest grazing		Forest without grazing					Soil organic carbon		Negative	Negative			Negative	Woods1982_40	Journal Article	1982	"Woods, R.

This study investigated the option of increasing carbon storage in biomass and poorly productive soils in dryland agricultural systems, while avoiding competition with food production, using tagasaste (Cytisus proliferus Link.), a woody N-fixing perennial species. Perennial plants often have deeper and more extensive root systems than annual plants, and therefore may increase soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks deeper than the IPCC standard sampling depth of 0.3m. Above- and below-ground biomass carbon and SOC to a depth of 2 m were measured on a 22-yr-old replicated field experiment in Western Australia (mean annual rainfall, 498 mm yr(-1)) comparing unmanaged plantations of tagasaste with conventional annual crop and pasture rotations. Carbon sequestration was 2.5 Mg Cha(-1) yr(-1) over the 22-yr lifespan for the tagasaste treatments, with a change of 0.9 Mg Cha(-1) yr(-1) in SOC and 1.6 Mg Cha(-1) yr(-1) in biomass. Tagasaste plots contained significantly larger SOC stocks compared with control plots for soil to 0.9 m, however beyond this depth, treatment differences were not significant. It is recommended that soil sampling be extended to depths of 1 m under such perennial systems with no benefit from sampling to depths deeper than this. In contrast to its current use as a fodder supplement for livestock, this study clearly demonstrates the potential of tagasaste for carbon mitigation within dryland farming systems, especially on soils marginal for conventional agriculture.

No significant difference was found in SOC or TOC between sample times, suggesting that under the conditions we examined, neither 2 years nor an intervening significant rainfall event was sufficient to change the quantity or our capacity to detect SOC, and neither represented a barrier to soil carbon accounting. Low fertility, lightly wooded pastures had a slightly but significantly lower SOC concentration, particularly in the surface soil layers. However, no significant differences in TOC were detected between the three pasture systems studied, and from a carbon estimation perspective, they represent one, single dataset. A wide range in TOC values existed within the dataset that could not be explained by environmental factors. The TOC was weakly but significantly correlated with soil nitrogen and phosphorus, but a more significant pattern seemed to be the association of high TOC with proportionally larger subsoil (0.1-0.3m) organic carbon storage. This we attribute to historical, long-term rather than contemporary management. Of the SOC fractions, particulate organic carbon (POC) dominated in the surface layers but diminished with depth, whereas the proportion of humic carbon (HUM) and resistant organic carbon (ROC) increased with soil depth. The POC did not differ between the pasture systems but native pasture had larger quantities of HUM and ROC, particularly in the surface soil layers, suggesting that this pasture system tends to accumulate organic carbon in more resistant forms, presumably because of litter input quality and historical management."	51	07-Aug			Australia	New South Wales	-32	147	Unclear		Wood pasture		Pasture without trees					Soil organic carbon		Negative					Wilson2007_65	Journal Article	2007	"Wilson, Brian R.; Growns, Ivor; Lemon, John"	"Scattered native trees and soil patterns in grazing land on the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia"	Australian Journal of Soil Research	Apr-73	10.1071/sr07019	<Go to ISI>://WOS:000246571100005	"Over large areas of south-eastern Australia, the original cover of native woodland has been extensively cleared or modi. ed, and what remains is often characterised by scattered trees beneath which the ground-storey vegetation is largely grazed or otherwise managed.

It is concluded that this acidi. cation provides strong evidence in support of a 'biological pumping' mechanism that has been proposed elsewhere. Key questions remain as to the management implications of these results, whether the subsurface acidi. cation that was observed is common among native Australian trees, if it might be persistent through time, and if this might be a soil issue that requires management."	45	3			Australia	New South Wales	-32	147	Unclear		Wood pasture		Pasture without trees					Soil organic carbon		Positive					Wilson2002_66	Journal Article	2002	"Wilson, Brian"	Influence of scattered paddock trees on surface soil properties: A study of the Northern Tablelands of NSW	Ecological Management & Restoration	1442-7001	10.1046/j.1442-8903.2002.00115.x	<Go to ISI>://BCI:BCI200300437719	"Surface soil conditions were assessed under three tree species on a property near Armidale on the Northern Tablelands of NSW. In both a stocked and adjacent destocked paddock, five trees each of three eucalypt species: Eucalyptus melliodora, Eucalyptus blakelyi and Eucalyptus nova-anglica, were selected. Soil samples were collected (depth 0-10 cm) along transects 20 m in length running from beneath the tree canopy progressively outwards into the open paddock. Six additional transects were also sampled outside the influence of the trees. Soil properties at a distance from the trees differed little between the stocked and destocked paddock with only a slight acidification in the stocked paddock. However, soil properties around the scattered trees showed considerable variation between stocked and destocked equivalents and most notably in a systematic pattern with distance from the trees themselves. For example, bulk density increased significantly, whereas soil pH, carbon, nitrogen and extractable phosphorus contents all decreased significantly with distance from the trees. However, stocking and camping had modified some of these soil properties. In the stocked paddock, the systematic change in nitrogen and phosphorus with distance from the trees was less clear and the degree of dispersion of the data was largest at the most heavily camped site. In this paddock, bulk density was also generally higher whereas pH, carbon and nitrogen contents were lower compared with the destocked equivalent. Extractable phosphorus content was also higher around the trees in the stocked paddock especially where camping activity was most intense. It is concluded that, although animal camping can modify their effects, scattered trees have a beneficial effect on soil properties and in this respect they have value in the grazing system from a soil conservation perspective."	3	3			Australia	New South Wales	-32	147	Unclear		Wood pasture		Other	Wood pasture without grazing				Soil organic carbon		Mixed results (negative and no effect)					Wilson1988_69	Journal Article	1988	"Wilson, A.

Factors contributing to differences in forage yield in the semi-arid woodlands	Australian Rangeland Journal	0313-4555			"A series of experimental sites, which were all on the same land unit but which differed in present condition, were established in the semiarid woodlands near Cobar, New South Wales. The forage yield on these plots was measured quarterly over a 2-year period. Associated measurements were made of species composition, forage quality, shrub and tree cover, area of eroded surface and soil fertility (available P, organic C, organic N and available N). Mean forage yield varied from 34 to 237 kg/ha. A major proportion of this variation was explained by total shrub and tree cover, organic N and organic C in the surface soil. Differences in N content were considered to have arisen by differential erosion, but this was more accurately characterized by laboratory measures than by field observations of the extent of soil erosion. Some differences were recorded in the composition of the herbaceous layer between plots, including a dominance of perennial grasses such as Danthonia caespitosa and Enteropogon acicularis on plots that had been excluded from grazing. However, nearly all species were edible so that composition differences were not a major contributor to variation in digestible forage yield. Perennial forbs (e.g. Sclerolaena diacantha) had the highest digestibility and biennial grasses (e.g. Stipa variabilis) the lowest. Total shrub and tree cover and the extent and severity of erosion are recommended as the most useful variables for monitoring changes in pastoral productivity of the semiarid woodlands."	10	1		agroforestry; estimation; forage; forests; Grasslands; semiarid zones; Silvopastoral systems; techniques; woodland grasslands; yields	Australia	New South Wales	-31.48	145.23	Unclear		Wood pasture		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Decrease with increased tree density/cover/proximity								Willett2012_77	Journal Article	2012	"Willett, C.

The objective of this research was to determine the effect of stream order, adjacent land use, and season on streambank erosion rates. Thirty-four study sites were established in 2007 and 2008. within Crooked and Otter Creek watersheds, two claypan watersheds located in northeastern Missouri. At each site, field assessments of severely to very severely eroding bank length were determined along 300 to 400 m (984 to 1,312 ft) stream reaches. A factorial experimental design was implemented with four land uses (crop, forest, pasture, and riparian forest), three seasons, and three stream orders (1st, 2nd, and 3rd). Each treatment was replicated three times for each stream order, except for the cropped 3rd order treatment as only one suitable treatment site could be found. Streambank erosion was measured using erosion pins, which were installed in randomly assigned plots that included at least 20% of the eroded bank length within each site. The effect of different seasons was assessed by measuring the length of the exposed pins three times per year (March, July, and November). The bulk density and carbon and nitrogen content of bank material were also determined. Sediment loss rates showed that season and the three-way interaction between season, land use, and stream order were highly significant.. Erosion rates were consistently higher in the winter months than spring/summer and fall seasons; however, the significant three-way. interaction precluded a simple interpretation of the seasonal effect. Soil nutrient concentration data showed that forest sites had significantly lower C and N concentrations than other land uses. At the watershed scale, bank Sediment accounted for 79% to 96% of the total in-stream sediment and 21% to 24% of the total N exported from the study area. These results indicate that streambanks are the dominant source of sediment and a significant source of N in these streams. Therefore, improved management of riparian areas to decrease streambank erosion would result in significant water quality improvement in streams of the Central Claypan Areas in northeastern Missouri."	67	4			USA	Missouri	38.3566	Ê-92.458	Unclear		Riparian strip		Pasture without trees											No effect	Welsch2016_95	Journal Article	2016	"Welsch, Johannes; Hale, Roddy J.; Buckley, Hannah L.; Case, Bradley S."

This is particularly true in intensively-farmed landscapes where it is of interest to quantify the role of small, woody vegetation features in providing ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration. However, soil variability introduced by natural and management processes can interact with sampling designs to result in inappropriate sampling intensities and high levels of uncertainty in measured indicators. This can have consequences for upscaling of ecosystem quantities and decision making. Here, we present results from a pilot study aimed at quantifying and understanding variation in ten common indicators of soil condition and function, within shelterbelt and adjacent field soils, at four dryland sheep farms in Canterbury, New Zealand. Our results demonstrate a high level of spatially-structured soil variability, driven by (1) the effects of woody vegetation on shelterbelt soils relative to field soils, (2) differences in underlying soil types among sites, and (3) possible effects of grazing animals within fields. This soil variability had clear knock-on impacts for appropriate sampling effort, depending on the soil indicator in question, the original soil sampling density, and whether the aim was to estimate population mean values or to detect differences among sites with confidence. On the whole, confidence in soil indicator estimates was highest for soil condition indicators (pH, soil moisture, bulk density), variable for carbon quantities, depending on the measure used, and lowest for soil biological process indicators (tea bag index decomposition rate, bait lamina probe micro-invertebrate activity, and dehydrogenase enzyme activity); estimation confidence was also mostly lower for shelterbelt soils due to the effect of woody roots and inputs on soil variability. Based on our results, we present indicative sample size requirements to estimate population means for these different soil indicators. Ultimately, we advocate for the use of pilot studies, such as the one presented here, to facilitate understanding of variability in soil function indicators within different agroecosystems, and how this variability is partitioned spatially within and among vegetated features.

A buffer strip experiment consisting of two tree species (Eucalyptus camaldulensis and Casuarina cunninghamiana) with two planting densities and a pasture treatment was conducted to determine the effectiveness of NO3-N removal from a cattle feedlot effluent disposal area at Tullimba near Armidale, NSW Australia. Different management methods were applied for the buffers where grass and weeds were mowed 2-3 times during the second and third years and were not managed during the rest experimental years for the tree buffer, while grass was harvested 1-3 times per year for the pasture buffer. The differences between tree species and planting density significantly affected tree growth, but the growth difference did not significantly affect their capacities to reduce NO3-N in soil surface runoff and groundwater. On average for all the tree and pasture treatments, the buffer strips reduced NO3-N concentration by 8.5%, 14.7% and 14.4% for the surface runoff, shallow and deep groundwater respectively. The tree and pasture buffer strips were not significantly different in NO3-N reduction for both shallow and deep groundwater while the pasture buffer strips reduced significantly more NO3-N concentration in surface runoff than the tree buffer strips. Both buffer strips reduced more than 50% of surface runoff volume indicating that both the tree and pasture buffer strips were efficient at removing water and nutrients, mostly through a significant reduction in soil surface runoff volume.

Assessment of the economic and ecological impacts of remnant vegetation on pasture productivity	Pacific Conservation Biology	1038-2097		<Go to ISI>://BCI:BCI200000242481	"The decline of remnant native vegetation in Australia is a national concern, with mounting community pressure on private landholders to actively manage and conserve the remaining vegetation on their properties. One of the major concerns of landholders in retaining and managing remnant vegetation in the agricultural landscape is the lack of information and understanding about the costs and benefits potentially associated with remnant vegetation, and how these values are linked to ecological functions. This paper focuses on the impacts of remnant vegetation on pasture productivity. Knowledge of the economic impacts of remnant vegetation on pasture productivity and associated agricultural output is currently limited, while the ecological relationships are better known but may vary with species and environment. Based on a study area near Gunnedah in northern New South Wales where farm survey data and GIS information were available, a model that incorporates agricultural and biophysical attributes to explain pasture productivity was developed. The results indicate that the value of pasture output per farm may be increased by having a certain proportion of pasture area under dry sclerophyll or woodland vegetation. Gross value of pasture output was at its highest level when the proportion of tree area across the farm was at 34%, with no further increases in output being achieved beyond this point. These results suggest that the competitive influences of trees present in the pasture system may begin to outweigh the stimulatory effects when this proportion of tree area is exceeded."	5	1			Australia	New South Wales	-31	150.08	Sheep		Silvopasture		Other	Different densities of trees	Understory/pasture production		Decrease with increased tree density/cover/proximity								Wall2010_115	Journal Article	2010	"Wall, Andrew J.; Kemp, Peter D.; Mackay, Alec D.; Power, Ian L."

The ability of several easily measured stand inventory parameters to predict understorey DIFN was then evaluated using regression analysis. Pasture net herbage accumulation (NHA) was also measured below the fully foliated trees and related to understorey DIFN. A directly inverse relationship between DIFN in the gap between tree crowns and stand canopy closure measured with a standard digital camera was found to be the simplest, most accurate and robust of the stand parameters examined. In comparison, there were site differences in the relationship for this understorey environment for all of the stand parameters based on individual tree metrics. Site differences in the relationship for DIFN directly underneath the tree-crowns were also apparent for both the stand parameters based on individual tree metrics and digital photographs. Inter-site variation in these relationships was attributed to unaccounted differences in stand leaf area. There was a strong straight-line relationship between DIFN and understorey pasture NHA.

Poplars markedly reduced annual pasture production by up to 50% at high canopy closure. To maintain pasture production at 65-75% of uneroded open pasture, poplar canopy closure should not exceed 50%.

Atriplex nummularia Lindl. is a perennial shrub commonly established for livestock forage on saline land, however, its potential for carbon mitigation has not been systematically evaluated. Similarly, although revegetation is an allowable activity to mitigate carbon within Article 3.4 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's Kyoto Protocol, there is a paucity of information on rates of carbon mitigation in soils and biomass through this mechanism. For six sites where A. nummularia had been established across southern Australia four were used to assess changes in soil carbon storage and four were used to develop biomass carbon sequestration estimates. A generalised allometric equation for above and below ground biomass was developed, with a simple crown volume index explaining 81% of the variation in total biomass. There were no significant differences in soil organic carbon storage to 0.3 m or 2 m depth compared to existing agricultural land-use. Between 2.2 and 8.3 Mg C ha(-1) or 0.2-0.6 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) was sequestered in above and below ground biomass and this translates to potential total sequestration of 1.1-3.6 Tg C yr(-1) on saline land across Australia.

We aimed at evaluating in a temperate region (Belgium) to what extent cattle may suffer from heat stress (measured through body temperature, respiration rate and panting score, cortisol or its metabolites in milk, and feces on hot days) and at assessing the potential benefits of shade. During the summer of 2012, 20 cows were kept on pasture without access to shade. During the summer of 2011, ten cows had access to shade (young trees with shade cloth hung between them), whereas ten cows had no access. Climatic conditions were quantified by the Heat Load Index (HLI). In animals without access to shade respiration rates, panting scores, rectal temperatures, and milk cortisol concentrations increased as HLI increased in both 2011 and 2012. Fecal cortisol metabolites varied with HLI in 2011 only. When cattle had access to shade, their use of shade increased as the HLI increased. This effect was more pronounced during the last part of the summer, possibly due to better acquaintance with the shade construction. In this case, shade use increased to 65% at the highest HLI (79). Shade tempered the effects on respiration, rectal temperature, and fecal cortisol metabolites. Milk cortisol was not influenced by HLI for cows using shade for >10% of the day. Therefore, even in temperate areas, cattle may suffer from heat when they are at pasture in summer and providing shade can reduce such stress."	62	4		blood chemistry; body temperature; cows; dairy cattle; dairy cows; faeces composition; heat stress; hydrocortisone; metabolites; milk; milk composition; respiration rate; shade; shade plants; shade trees; stress; stress response; summer; temperate climate; temperate zones; trees; woody plants	Belgium		50.86	3.47	Cattle		Shelterbelt/Windbreak	Block of trees with shade cloth	Pasture without trees		Livestock heat stress		Positive								Varella2011_147	Journal Article	2011	"Varella, A.

This coverage level is achieved by applying pruning and strong thinning to reduce the volume of timber production per area unit. From an economic standpoint, in order to not reduce the income level of the system, it is necessary to find tree species that could replace ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and maximize income per volume unit of wood. We evaluated the feasibility of implementation of five broadleaved tree species (native and exotic) with higher intrinsic wood quality than ponderosa pine. We tested the influence of tree cover generated by a framework of silvopastoral plantation on the increase in survival, regrowth and absolute increase in height, and compared ecophysiological variables (net photosynthetic activity, stomatal conductance, intrinsic water use efficiency) of different species to the status of a traditional plantation without tree cover. Additionally values of air temperature and relative humidity were registered under both cover conditions. Preliminary results support the conclusion that three of these five species could be considered as alternatives to ponderosa pine species for establishing silvopastoral systems with higher timber value.

During the summer of 2012, a herd of Holstein cows was kept on pasture without access to shade (treatment NS). During the summers of 2011 and 2013, the herd was divided into a group with (treatment S) and a group without (treatment NS) access to shade. Shade was provided by young trees combined with shade cloths (80% reduction in solar radiation). A weather station registered the local climatic conditions on open pasture, from which we calculated daily average Heat Load Index (HLI) values. The effects of HLI and shade on rectal temperature (RT), blood plasma indicators of hyperventilation and metabolic changes due to heat stress, milk yield and milk composition were investigated. RT increased with increasing HLI, but was less for S cows than for NS cows (by 0.02 degrees C and 0.03 degrees C increase per unit increase of HLI, respectively). Hyperchloraemia (an increased blood plasma concentration of Cl-), a sign of hyperventilation, increased for NS cows but not for S cows. The plasma concentration of alkaline phosphatase, a regulator of energy metabolism in the liver, decreased with increasing HLI for NS cows only. Access to shade, thus, reduced the effect of HLI on RT, hyperchloraemia and the regulation of metabolism by the liver. As HLI increased, the plasma concentration of cholesterol decreased (indicating increased lipolysis) and the plasma concentration of creatinine increased (indicating increased protein catabolism). These effects did not differ between S and NS cows. For NS cows, after a lag-time of 2 days, the milk yield decreased with increasing HLI. For S cows, the milk yield was unaffected by HLI and its quadratic factor. The milk concentrations of lactose, protein and fat decreased as HLI increased, but only the effect on milk protein content was remediated by shade. In conclusion, access to shade tempered the negative effects of high HLI on RT, hyperchloraemia and a blood plasma indicator of changing energy metabolism (generally) as well as prevented the decrease in milk yield observed in cows without access to shade."	9	9			Belgium		50.59	3.46	Cattle		Shelterbelt/Windbreak	Block of trees with shade cloth	Pasture without trees		Milk yield		Positive								Van Laer2015_155	Journal Article	2015	"Van Laer, E.; Moons, C.

In 2013, however, at HLI = 90, shade use probability reached 48% for dairy cows and 41% for beef cows. For animals from the NS treatment we determined the effect of hot summer conditions on RR and PS (with 0 = no panting and 4.5 = extreme panting). In both types of cattle, an increase in black globe temperature was the best predictor for increasing RR and PS. Furthermore, we determined how the effect of hot summer conditions on RR and PS was affected by the use of shade. Under hot conditions (black globe temperature >= 30 degrees C), >50% of the animals under shade retained normal PS and RR (PS < 1 and RR < 90 breaths per minute), whereas normal RR and PS were significantly less prevalent for animals outside shade. Our findings suggest that, even in temperate summers, heat can induce thermal discomfort in cattle, as evidenced by increases in shade use, RR and PS, and that shade increases thermal comfort."	9	9			Belgium		50.59	3.46	Cattle	Both dairy and beef cattle	Shelterbelt/Windbreak	Block of trees with shade cloth	Pasture without trees		Livestock heat stress		Positive								Valtorta1997_157	Journal Article	1997	"Valtorta, S.

The artificial structure consisted of a black woven polypropylene cloth providing 80% shade, mounted on 2.5-m-high eucalyptus posts. The work was carried out at Rafaela Experimental Station, Argentina, during the summer (January and February) 1994. BGTs and floor temperatures were measured in concrete floor holding pens with and without artifical shade. The results showed no difference between TS1, TS2 and AS, their average BGTs being 30.2 (SD 0.58), 29.0 (SD 0.70) and 30.2 (SD 0.74)degrees C, respectively. BGTs under all three shades were significantly lower (P<0.01) than the average BGT recorded outside: 35.5 (SD 1.12)degrees C. Average BGTs in holding pens were 32.4 (SD 1.38) and 39.9 (SD 1.91)degrees C for shaded and non-shaded areas (P<0.01). The corresponding average floor temperatures were 27.8 (SD 0.68)degrees C and 47.7 (SD 2.13)degrees C (P<0.01). To assess the effects of shade on animal well-being, afternoon rectal temperatures (RT) and respiratory rate (respirations per minute, RR) of lactating cows were recorded twice a week. Rectal temperatures were significantly higher for non-shaded cows (P<0.01), mean RT being 40.1 (SD 0.65)degrees C vs 39.3 (SD 0.42)degrees C for the shaded animals. Corresponding RRs were 78.9 (SD 18.0) and 60.7 (SD 10.6) (P<0.05).

Appropriate implementation of silvopastoral practices in dehesa systems may contribute to their sustainability; improve soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage capacity while reducing the carbon dioxide (CO2) flux from the soil to the atmosphere. The response of soil respiration (Rs) to grazing and tilling practices and trees canopy influence were studied in a dehesa ecosystem in the center of Spain from July 2008 to February 2010. Four different treatments were established: non grazed-non tilled; non grazed-tilled; grazed-non tilled and grazed and tilled. In all the treatments R-s, soil temperature (T-s), soil moisture (M-s), soil C and N stocks were measured. Grazing reduced Rs by 12 % across all experiment. Increments of 3 Mg/ha in C stocks and 0.3 Mg/ha in N stocks in grazing soils were observed. Although, no clear tilling effect on Rs was found, a decrease of 3.5 Mg/ha in soil C stocks and 0.3 Mg/ha in N stocks was detected in tilled soils. Presence of tree canopy induced increases in Rs, soil C and N stocks; while decreases in T-s were observed, but grazing decreased the tree canopy influence on annual C losses by Rs. The M-s constrained the temperature response of Rs during the experiment, and meaningful Q10 values were only obtainable during the wettest time, ranging from 2.5 to 5.7. Grazing and tree canopy had a positive influence in the ability of soils to store soil C and N, while tilling had a negative effect on soil C and N store capacity in this study. Maintaining the beneficial practices and improving tillage management in this area may have important consequences in carbon sequestration capacity in this dehesa system."	89	2			Spain		39.59	-5.8	Mixture of sheep and cattle		Dehesa/Montado		Forest without grazing	Dehesa without grazing				Soil organic carbon		Positive					Upson2016_164	Journal Article	2016	"Upson, M.

Soil organic carbon was measured in pasture, silvopastoral tree, and woodland treatments at six depths representative of 0-150 cm. Fourteen years after tree planting, the organic carbon content in the surface soil layer (0-10 cm) was greatest in the pasture (6.0 g 100 g(-1)) and least in the woodland (4.6 g 100 g(-1)); the value (5.3 g 100 g(-1)) below the silvopastoral trees was intermediate. In the 10-20 cm layer, the organic carbon content in the woodland was 13% lower than the pasture. No treatment effects on soil carbon were detected below 20 cm. Possible reasons for the decline in surface soil carbon include a decline in grass cover and reduced soil water content Measurements of above ground carbon storage by the trees indicated that tree planting increased overall carbon storage, with the silvopastoral system predicted to achieve a higher level of carbon storage than equivalent areas of separate woodland and pasture. A power analysis indicates that a prohibitively large number of replicates is needed to ensure a lower than 20% risk of falsely concluding no treatment differences at individual depth increments below 10 cm and cumulative depths extending below 40 cm.

The grazing study consists of six watersheds in the Central Mississippi Valley wooded slopes and the row crop study site consists of three watersheds in a paired watershed design in Central Claypan areas. Runoff water samples were analyzed for sediment, total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) for the 2004 to 2008 period. Results indicate that agroforestry and grass buffers on grazed and row crop management sites significantly reduce runoff, sediment, TN, and TP losses to streams. Buffers in association with grazing and row crop management reduced runoff by 49 and 19%, respectively, during the study period as compared with respective control treatments. Average sediment loss for grazing and row crop management systems was 13.8 and 17.9 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. On average, grass and agroforestry buffers reduced sediment, TN, and TP losses by 32, 42, and 46% compared with the control treatments. Buffers were more effective in the grazing management practice than row crop management practice. These differences could in part be attributed to the differences in soils, management, and landscape features.

Four types of oak communities were selected, each with five replicates: oak shrublands (SL), dehesas (DE) or open woodlands used for grazing, and two types of mature oak forest, one with abundant shrub biomass in the understory (FS) and the other with little shrub biomass in the understory (FO). A total of 175 species were found in the 20 sites studied, 52 appeared in a single site. The dehesas were the most different regarding species composition, with 30 species only found there. This was verified by a qualitative similarity analysis, in which the five dehesas formed a group clearly distinguishable from the other sites; the oak shrublands also formed a group, but it was not possible to distinguish between the mature oak forests with and without a shrubby understory. However, the soil characteristics were similar across all sites and differences could only be detected in organic matter and nitrogen content, which were significantly higher in the mature forests without a shrubby understory. When the plant community and soil characteristics were analysed as a whole using a canonical correspondence analysis, the separation of the dehesas was observed on the first axis, due to its greater richness and abundance in herb species, especially annuals. The other sites were ordered on the second axis, with greater differences between the oak shrublands, associated with higher shrub species cover, and the mature open forests, associated with forest herb species and a soil with a higher nitrogen, organic matter and cation exchange content. The mature forests with abundant shrub biomass were in an intermediate position. Therefore, although the differences in soil were not important and many species were common to all types of Q. pyrenaica communities, the type of human intervention did determine changes, as shown by the results of the multifactorial analyses. In addition, given that all the community types presented some species which were not found in the other types, greater biodiversity would be attained by preserving all of them.

It has ensured the stability of marginal areas and sustained diversity. Following ownership changes in 1989, Hungarian agricultural activities diversified again and, on private farms, opened a range of options to plan and revitalize agroforestry systems, mainly based on the shelterbelt-systems of the 1960s. This paper reviews trends and possibilities in landscape-management both in specific locations and countrywide. In addition to the agroforestry potential there are examples of conservation, landscape protection and ethnic heritage of these farming methods. Because of changes in land structure and the accession of Hungary to the EU, the economic objectives of afforestation are increasing. The protective functions of forests as shelterbelts, landscape enhancement and settlement-protection are also being felt. It is expected to be an increase in shelterbelts, windbreaks, forest belts, hedgerows and alleys. Surveys in forest, and non-forest scenarios need to be followed by long term planning, which should increase forest protection.

Installation of vegetated buffers on loamy soils dramatically reduced the bacterial contamination of runoff water from manure-treated pasturelands, but the size of the vegetated buffer was not an important determinant of bacterial removal efficiency. Only 10% of the runoff samples collected from treatment cells having vegetated buffers exhibited FCB concentrations > 200 colony forming units (cfu)/100 mL (a common water quality standard value), and the median concentration for all cells containing vegetated buffers was only 6 cfu/100 mL. The presence of a vegetated buffer of any size, from 1 to 25 m, generally reduced the median FCB concentration in runoff by more than 99%. Results for FCB load calculations were similar. Our results suggest that where substantial FCB contamination of runoff occurs from manure-treated pasturelands, it might be disproportionately associated with specific field or management conditions, such as the presence of soils that exhibit low water infiltration and generate larger volumes of runoff or the absence of a vegetated buffer.

Severing lateral tree roots (root-pruning), harvesting mallees and allowing them to coppice, or thinning trees for sawlog regimes increased the yield of crops and pastures in the competition zone. In some instances, these increases were significant: root-pruning increased the annual return from crops grown in the competition zone of Pinus radiata by up to $548/km of the tree line at 1 site. Conversely, root-pruning reduced tree growth by 14 - 43% across all sites. Therefore, where trees provide benefits, such as shelter from damaging winds, the benefits of reduced tree - crop competition may not offset the consequent reduction in rate of tree growth. For mallee - crop alley systems on agriculturally productive soils, mallee growth rates must be high enough to compensate for crop losses in the competition zone. On less agriculturally productive soils, block-planting mallees may be more profitable than alley systems or crops without competition (sole-crops). This research has shown that competition management strategies can be used to manipulate the relative productivity of trees, crops and pasture at the tree - agriculture interface. The use of these strategies will depend on the relative economic value of tree and crop products and the value placed on other tree benefits, such as shelter and reduced groundwater recharge."	45	11	26-33		Australia		-25.274398	133.775136	Pasture without livestock		Biofuel		Pasture without trees												Mixed results (positive and negative)Sudmeyer2008_216	Journal Article	2008	"Sudmeyer, R.

During the 1980s and early 1990s it was widely believed that agroforestry offered one of the best hopes for reducing the area at risk from salinisation while improving the productivity of conventional agricultural enterprises and providing new sources of income to landholders. This paper details the hydrogeology, tree water use and the productivity of Eucalyptus globulus, crops and pastures in an agroforestry system on the south coast of Western Australia with deep sandy soils and rising groundwater. The tree-belts directly occupied 10% of the catchment and the lateral spread of outer tree roots meant recharge was effectively eliminated over 20% of the catchment. However, groundwater at the site continued to rise for 13 years after the trees were planted. Sapflow and tree growth measurements showed that the trees did not access the brackish groundwater (>500 mg/L) present over most of the site. Consequently, tree growth was relatively poor (5 m(3)/ha/yr for inner trees) and the estimated economic returns from pulpwood production were less than from agriculture. While the outer tree rows grew at 8 times the rate of inner rows, this was at the expense of reduced crop and pasture growth in the adjacent 15-20 m wide competition zone (CZ). If the area of the CZ where agricultural production was less than breakeven is considered, then the outer tree rows grew at a similar rate (expressed on an area basis) as the inner rows. This suggests there was no economic advantage in growing pulpwood in belts rather than blocks at this site. Thinning the trees to 125 stems/ha allowed improved crop and pasture production and reduced wind erosion in the CZ, and facilitated greater growth rates of the remaining trees. It remains to be determined whether increased economic returns from the trees will compensate for the cost of thinning and pruning. This study has shown that E. globulus is not a suitable agroforestry tree species for medium rainfall sites with deep sands and brackish groundwater, other tree species may be more suited to these sites and achieve better economic and hydrological outcomes for landholders.

Although mallees are planted on >12 700 ha across the south-west of Western Australia, very little commercial harvesting of mallee has occurred to date. The development of biomass processing industries is constrained by lack of robust information regarding the productivity of integrated mallee and agricultural systems. This study addresses this constraint by quantifying the productivity and economics of agricultural crops and pastures growing in the competition zone adjacent to mallee belts at 15 sites across the Western Australian wheatbelt. The sites covered a range of climate and edaphic conditions, three mallee species (Eucalyptus polybractea R Baker, E. loxophleba ssp. lissophloia LAS Johnson and KD Hill, or E. kochii ssp. plenissima (CA Gardner) Brooker), various crop and pasture rotations, and various mallee harvest-management treatments. Mallee-crop competition was negatively correlated with rainfall and positively correlated with mallee age and size, and greater for crops than pasture. Consequently, extent and magnitude of competition were highly variable across sites and years. On average, mallee-crop competition extended 11.3m from unharvested belts and reduced crop and pasture yields by 36% within 2-20m of the mallee belts relative to open paddock yields. This is similar to what has been reported for taller tree species. Harvesting mallees reduced competition such that crop and pasture yield was reduced by 22 or 27% relative to open paddock yields for mallees harvested at 3- or 6+-year intervals, respectively. The economic cost of mallee-crop competition on agricultural enterprises was also highly variable between sites, and between years within individual sites. Averaged across all site-years, the opportunity cost of competition was equivalent to forgoing agricultural production for 14.4m on each side of unharvested mallee belts, or 9-10m on each side of harvested belts. Farmers with mallee agroforestry systems will need to manage the economic impacts of competition by reducing agricultural input costs in the competition zone, timing crop-grazing rotations with mallee harvests, ensuring that the width of alleys is at least 25 times the height of the mature trees, and possibly root-pruning mallees in unharvested or long harvest interval systems. This research has shown that mallee-crop competition presents a significant cost to farmers and must be considered when designing mallee agroforestry systems. The findings have relevance for the development of appropriate biomass and carbon sequestration pricing benchmarks for mallee plantings."	63	6	140-140		Australia		-25.274398	133.775136	Pasture without livestock		Biofuel		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Negative								Unclear from articleStewart2011_230	Journal Article	2011	"Stewart, Hugh T.

An element of the policy was the development of a commercial forestry and farm forestry culture. In this context, farm forestry was intended to provide the opportunity to integrate smaller-scale plantations into agricultural landscapes on private land. Against this background, a study was undertaken to analyse the socio-economic returns from farm forestry in a case study in south-east Australia. Financial information during 1993-2007 for livestock grazing and 8 ha of blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus) was analysed to compare the profitability of farming and farm forestry. During this period, a full cycle of blue gum (14 years) to produce pulp logs was completed with a forestry company under a tree farming agreement. The blue gum was integrated with the livestock enterprise by planting the trees in belts that were mostly 10 rows or 30 m wide positioned 250-300 m apart and located strategically on productive agricultural land along land-class boundaries. For the blue gum farm forestry, the net present value to the farmer expressed in 1993 dollars was $1236/ha compared to $768/ha for livestock grazing during 1993-2007. The farmer reported they had successfully integrated farm forestry as a land-use, and that the farm forestry had provided important environmental benefits and social benefits. The farmer was committed to farm forestry being part of the diversified farming business into the future, with the management of a second crop of blue gum on the farm underway. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

However, since nearly all of these reports have been time-point comparisons, utilizing long-term paired-sites, properties of transitional states and time of their appearance can only be inferred at present. In this study, a deciduous forest ecosystem was converted to a silvopasture ecosystem by tree thinning, fertilization, and sheep incorporation of seed and forest litter. After 2 years, topsoil (0-15 cm) physico-chemical properties, particularly P fractions, and phosphatases were monitored over the growing season in these ecosystems, and a nearby pasture ecosystem. Initially, before spring vegetative growth, differences were found for pH, exchangeable cations and soil moisture, most of which could be explained by management history. Compared to forest, organic-C (C(o)) and organic-N (N(o)) concentrations were reduced in silvopasture by 17 and 9%, respectively, indicative of substantial litter decomposition. Most values for all these physico-chemical properties for silvopasture were intermediate between forest and pasture, and generally remained so throughout the growing season. Initial total P (TP(t)), organic-P (TP(o)) and inorganic-P (TP(i)) concentrations were generally as anticipated for the forest and pasture. Silvopasture, however, had 36 and 23% greater TP(o) than forest and pasture, respectively, presumably due to fertilizer-P immobilization induced by incorporation of forest litter. Total P components remained essentially constant over the growing season in all ecosystems, with the exception of pasture, likely due to high forage TP(i) uptake. Bray I-extractable-organic-P (BrP(o)) and bicarbonate-extractable-organic-P (BiP(o)) concentrations, although consistently highest in the forest and silvopasture soils, were not reflective of the increase in TP(o) under silvopasture. Acid phosphatase (PMEac) activities were highest in spring in all the ecosystems, then gradually declined to typically 25-50% initial activities. Alkaline phosphatase (PMEal) activities showed a broadly-similar pattern, with exception of forest and silvopasture soils, which exhibited low activities throughout the season. For the entire data set, PMEac and PMEal activities were poorly correlated with TP(i,) BrP(i), and BiP(i). These results demonstrate that conversion of forest to silvopasture results in soil changes indicative of its rapid transition to pasture and that an increased P(o) reservoir results that should be taken into account in fertilizer-P recommendations for temperate silvopastures."	74	3	114-127		USA	West Virginia	37.48	-80.58	Sheep		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees					Soil organic carbon		Positive					Sovell2000_253	Journal Article	2000	"Sovell, L.

Specifically, we examined the effect of rotationally and continuously grazed pastures and different types of riparian buffer strips on water chemistry, physical habitat, benthic macroinvertebrates, and fish as indicators of stream quality. We collected data at 17 sites under different combinations of grazing and riparian management, using a longitudinal design on three streams and a paired watershed design on two others. Continuous and rotational grazing were compared along one longitudinal study stream and at the paired watershed. Riparian buffer management, fenced trees (wood buffer), fenced grass, and unfenced rotationally grazed areas were the focus along the two remaining longitudinal streams. Principal components analysis (PCA) of water chemistry, physical habitat, and biotic data indicated a local management effect. The ordinations separated continuous grazing from sites with rotational grazing and sites with wood buffers from those with grass buffers or rotationally grazed areas. Fecal coliform and turbidity were consistently higher at continuously grazed than rotationally grazed sites. Percent fines in the streambed were significantly higher at sites with wood buffers than grass and rotationally grazed areas, and canopy cover was similar at sites with wood and grass buffers. Benthic macroinvertebrate metrics were significant but were not consistent across grazing and riparian buffer management types. Fish density and abundance were related to riparian buffer type, rather than grazing practices. Our study has potentially important implications for stream restoration programs in the midwestern United Slates. Our comparisons suggest further consideration and study of a combination of grass and wood riparian buffer strips as midwestern stream management options, rather than universally installing wood buffers in every instance."	26	6	240		USA	Minnesota	46.2807	-94.3053	Cattle		Riparian strip		Pasture without trees									Mixed results (negative and no effect)			Smith1942_264	Journal Article	1942	"Smith, R.

However, the quantitative benefits of this practice are difficult to predict for a range of water quality parameters. It also has been generally unclear in Australia how codes of forest practice apply to situations where land managers want to use forest plantation trees in stream-side buffers for both environmental and commercial benefits. We are conducting research to quantify the effects on water quality and stream flow of using plantation buffers on pastured farmland, and developing knowledge and guidelines that will influence policy and practice. A paired-catchment experiment of the plantation establishment phase has commenced, and other work will address the harvesting phase and farm-scale economics. A range of water quality parameters are being monitored, with hillslope nitrogen dynamics a particular focus for measurement and modelling. In the establishment phase experiment, pre-establishment monitoring of water quality was followed by installation of the plantation buffer in August 2008. Early results indicate that soil disturbance close to the stream associated and with spot cultivation for tree seedlings has not adversely affected turbidity of stream water. The HYDRUS model (including the CW2D nitrogen module) will be used for modelling hillslope nitrogen dynamics (mineralisation, nitrification, leaching, runoff, denitrification and uptake) as affected by buffer establishment. The buffer could particularly affect soil water status, denitrification and uptake, the combined effect of which could mitigate nitrogen delivery to the stream. By validating this approach in the experimental catchment, we expect to provide a modelling framework that can be applied to a diverse range of situations, e.g. designing buffer widths and management to achieve particular water quality nitrogen objectives in contrasting soil and climate conditions. Early results will be shown that indicate progress towards this objective. By linking various aspects of the research we expect to influence streamside buffer adoption and management at several scales. At the national and state scales we are in the process of advising regulators on improvements to codes of forest practice and policy options that encourage adoption. At the regional scale we have started advising natural resource managers of the quantitative effects of streamside buffers on water outcomes. At the farm scale we will be developing guidelines for the practical aspects of buffer management and advising on the expected costs and benefits."			20-24		Australia	Tasmania	-43.13	147.02	Cattle		Riparian strip		Pasture without trees									No effect			Sinnett2016_280	Journal Article	2016	"Sinnett, Alexandria; Behrendt, Ralph; Ho, Christie; Malcolm, Bill"	The carbon credits and economic return of environmental plantings on a prime lamb property in south eastern Australia	Land Use Policy	0264-8377	10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.12.023	<Go to ISI>://WOS:000372387900034	"In Australia, an approved farm action under the Emissions Reduction Fund is for farmers to establish permanent tree plantations. For a livestock farmer who is considering establishing environmental plantings of trees for carbon sequestration, the question is 'what are the benefits and costs of growing trees instead of using that land to grow pasture to feed livestock?' In this research, the case study approach and the methods of farm management economics were applied to assess whether growing trees for carbon on part of a prime lamb case study farm in south-west Victoria could be a better use of resources than using that land to graze livestock. The question was investigated for a range of economic and environmental conditions over 25 and 100 years. A condition was that the trees provided no other benefit on farm and the required rate of return on marginal capital was 6% real (10% nominal). The results indicated that the price of carbon would need to be $AUD132/t CO(2)e for growing trees solely for carbon sequestration to be a good investment. Alternatively, if the trees provided benefits in addition to carbon credits, such as shelter for vulnerable young lambs, the investment could be worthwhile to the business at a lower carbon price. Previous research has shown that shelter (in the form of trees, grasshedge rows and other man-made structures) can reduce lamb mortality by reducing wind chill at lambing, through reduced wind speed. The benefits to a farm system from growing trees for carbon depends on the reduction in wind speed the trees create, the weather conditions, the price of lambs, the establishment cost of the trees, the price of carbon, and transaction costs. The results of this research has shown that for the representative livestock farmer, growing trees for carbon is unlikely to be as profitable as alternative uses of their resources.

Canopy structure data were collected by destructive sampling of trees removed from the experimental area immediately prior to its establishment, and from subsequent measurements on growing trees during the following 2 years. In New Zealand, it was found that relative pasture yield (the ratio of growth below a canopy to open pasture growth) was linearly related to green crown length in the case of Pinus radiata canopies. More recently, a family of relationships between relative pasture yield and green crown length, indexed by the mean height of trees forming the canopy has been derived. For our data, the regression of annual herbage yield on green crown length is good (R2 = 92.5%) but shows systematic variation in the residuals. Hence, other related explanatory variables were investigated to see if any gave a more satisfactory fit to the data. By assuming that individual trees have a canopy in the shape of a regular cone, the areas of the projections of the tree canopies at different inclinations to the vertical were calculated. If it is further assumed that the canopies are of even density, the projections can be used to estimate the proportion of direct light which is incident on the herbage under the trees as a function of the angle of the sun above the horizon. A regression using both vertical and horizontal projections in varying proportions indicated that the best fit to the data was obtained using the horizontal projection alone (R2 = 94.0%). These results indicate: first, that the horizontal projection of the crown gives a good, simple prediction of annual herbage yield; and secondly, that the horizontal component of incident light is most important for herbage growth at Scottish latitudes."	65	02-Mar	585-595		New Zealand		-40.900557	174.885971	Pasture without livestock		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Decrease with increased tree density/cover/proximity								Sibbald2001_299	Journal Article	2001	"Sibbald, A.

However, by year six WCONT and S100 were similar (180.7 +/- 17.31 cm) while S400 were taller (219.0 +/- 22.80 cm: P < 0.05). It is concluded that tree shelters maintained silvopastoral tree survival at the level of conventional woodland. Tree height extension was compromised on S100 where a higher animal:tree ratio resulted in greater animal activity and soil compaction around trees compared to S400. The site with poorly- drained soil proved to be unsuitable for sycamore-based silvopastoral agroforestry."	53	1	246-252		UK		55.378051	-3.435973	Sheep		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees		Livestock growth		No effect								Shvaleva2014_301	Journal Article	2014	"Shvaleva, Alla; Costa e Silva, Filipe; Costa, Joaquim Miguel; Correia, Alexandra; Anderson, Margaret; Lobo-do-Vale, Raquel; Fangueiro, David; Bicho, Catarina; Pereira, Joo Santos; Chaves, Maria Manuela; Skiba, Ute; Cruz, Cristina"	"Comparison of methane, nitrous oxide fluxes and CO2 respiration rates from a Mediterranean cork oak ecosystem and improved pasture"	Plant and Soil	0032-079X	10.1007/s11104-013-1923-6	<Go to ISI>://WOS:000328849200066	"During the recent decades, cork oak (Q. suber) mortality has been increasing in Mediterranean oak woodland endangering the economical and environmental sustainability of the ""montado"" ecosystem. This fact in combination with climate change and conversion of forestland to pasture may significantly affect the soil-atmosphere greenhouse gases (GHGs) exchange. Our study evaluates the impact of oak trees as compared to pasture on net ecosystem GHG (CH4, N2O, and CO2) exchange as well as the main environmental factors influencing this exchange. We used field chamber measurements for the collection of GHGs under three different conditions: 1) open area (OA), 2) under tree canopy area (UC) and 3) improved pasture (IP). Experiments were done under typical Mediterranean climate at central Portugal in 2010 and 2011. The UC had higher nitrification potential, soil C/N ratio, electrical conductivity, litter input and soil organic matter (SOM) than OA and IP. SOM positively correlated with soil CH4 and N2O fluxes but not with soil CO2 respiration rates. Soil water content (SWC) drives both CH4 and N2O fluxes. Under certain conditions, when SWC reached a threshold (7 % for CH4 and 3 % for N2O) the result was net uptake and that net uptake increased with SWC. This was the case for the UC and OA. Conversely, for the IP soil water content above 4 % promoted net CH4 release. Our results show that cork oak influences soil properties and consequently GHGs fluxes. In the UC the input of litter for SOM together with soil moisture, favoured microbiological activity and related GHGs fluxes. Soil temperature is a secondary factor in the studied conditions. Our results also emphasized the potential impact posed by decreased cork oak tree density in the functioning of the ""montado"" ecosystem."	374	01-Feb	75-80		Portugal		39.08	-8.2	Unclear		Dehesa/Montado		Pasture without trees					Soil organic carbon		Positive					Sharrow2007_313	Journal Article	2007	"Sharrow, Steven H."

Most silvopasture research to date has focused on forage/animal/tree interactions, with less attention paid to animal/soil interactions in silvopastures. While a considerable body of work has been devoted to understanding the effects of livestock trampling on plants and soils in pastures, less has been done for livestock grazing in forests, and even less is available for silvopastures. Three replications of Douglas-fir forest, Douglas-fir/subclover pasture/sheep silvopasture, and subclover/sheep pasture were established in 1989 near Corvallis, Oregon USA. Pastures and silvopastures were grazed each spring during 1990-2001. These plots were sampled in 2002, after 11 years of grazing, and again in 2004 following 2 years without grazing. Soil in the silvopastures had 13% higher bulk density and 7% lower total porosity than those in adjacent forests in 2002. Most of the difference in total porosity was air-filled pores. Average water infiltration rate was 38% less in silvopastures than in forests, however total water stored in the top 6 cm of soil at field capacity was similar. Soil bulk density, total porosity, and air-filled pore space was similar for forests, pastures, and silvopastures after 2 years without livestock grazing. The infiltration rate of silvopasture soils in 2004 had increased to be similar to those of forests in 2002, however, forest soil infiltration rates also increased and continued to be higher than those of silvopastures. Plant production was not sensitive to changes in any of the soil parameters measured. Although livestock grazing did change soil infiltration rates, soil bulk density, and soil porosity, the effects were quickly reversed following cessation of grazing and had little detrimental effect on silvopasture forage or tree production."	71	3	305-318		USA	Oregon	44.4	-123	Sheep		Silvopasture		Forest without grazing								Negative				Sharrow2004_314	Journal Article	2004	"Sharrow, S.

In contrast, temperate conifer forests often store large amounts of organic matter above-ground in woody plant tissue and fibrous litter. Silvopastures, which combine managed pastures with forest trees, should accrete more carbon and nitrogen than pastures or timber plantations because they may produce more total annual biomass and have both forest and grassland nutrient cycling patterns active. This hypothesis was investigated by conducting carbon and nitrogen inventories on three replications of 11 year-old Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii)/perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne)/subclover (Trifolium subterraneum) agroforests, ryegrass/subclover pastures, and Douglas-fir timber plantations near Corvallis, Oregon in August 2000. Over the 11 years since planting, agroforests accumulated approximately 740 kg ha-1 year-1 more C than forests and 520 kg ha-1 year-1 more C than pastures. Agroforests stored approximately 12% of C and 2% of N aboveground compared to 9% of C and 1% of N above ground in plantations and less than 1% of N and C aboveground in pastures. Total N content of agroforests and pastures, both of which included a nitrogen-fixing legume, were approximately 530 and 1200 kg ha-1 greater than plantations, respectively. These results support the proposition that agroforests, such as silvopastures, may be more efficient at accreting C than plantations or pasture monocultures. However, pastures may accrete more N than agroforests or plantations. This apparent separation of response in obviously interrelated agroecosystem processes, points out the difficulty in using forest plantation or pasture research results to predict outcomes for mixed systems such as agroforests."	60	2	48-62	agroforestry; agroforestry systems; carbon; carbon sequestration; forest plantations; nitrogen; nitrogen fixation; nitrogen fixing trees; nutrient content; pastures; silvopastoral systems; soil organic matter; trees; woody plants	USA	Oregon	44.4	-123	Sheep		Silvopasture		Other	Pasture without trees AND forest without grazing				Total carbon		Positive					Sharrow1996_317	Journal Article	1996	"Sharrow, S.

Farmers need information on pasture production and quality in order to assess the direct effect of tree presence on the productivity of their pastoral system, and to devise management that balances farm production and profitability with sustainable soil management. The main objectives of this work were (1) to evaluate tree influence on soil and pasture parameters and (2) to evaluate the use of proximal sensing techniques that have potential for monitoring aspects related to spatial and temporal variability of pasture productivity and quality in montado ecosystems. Both objectives can support the decision-making process of the farmer. The study field is located in Mitra farm, in Southern Portugal. During October 2015, 24 geo-referenced composite soil samples (12 under tree canopy and 12 outside tree canopy) were collected from the 0.0-0.3m soil layer. The soil samples were analysed for texture (sand, silt, and clay content), moisture content, pH, organic matter, total nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), and manganese (Mn). The evolution of the pasture was recorded in the 24 sampling points at five monitoring dates: at the end of autumn (December 2015), at the end of winter (March 2016), and then monthly during spring 2016 (April, May, and June). The following pasture parameters were measured: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), capacitance, temperature, green and dry matter, ash, crude protein (CP), and neutral detergent fibre. Soil under tree canopy had significantly higher levels of organic matter, N, P, K, and Mg, and better pasture quality while the pasture productivity was higher outside tree canopy. The correlation between pasture direct measurements and sensor parameters was more consistent between capacitance and pasture productivity and between NDVI and CP. The use of fast and efficient tools associated with geo-referenced systems can greatly simplify the pasture monitoring process, which is the basis for estimating feed availability in the field. The knowledge of biomass quality and quantity is fundamental to support decision-making regarding animal stocking rates and rotation among grazing parcels."	39	14	81-87		Portugal		38.3	-8.01	Sheep		Dehesa/Montado		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Negative	Soil organic carbon		Positive					Seddaiu2013_328	Journal Article	2013	"Seddaiu, Giovanna; Porcu, Giovanna; Ledda, Luigi; Roggero, Pier Paolo; Agnelli, Alberto; Corti, Giuseppe"	Soil organic matter content and composition as influenced by soil management in a semi-arid Mediterranean agro-silvo-pastoral system	Agriculture Ecosystems & Environment	0167-8809	10.1016/j.agee.2013.01.002	<Go to ISI>://WOS:000317326700001	"The aim of this study was to assess the impact of different long term soil managements on soil organic matter (SOM) quantity and quality in a semi-arid Mediterranean dehesa-like agro-forestry system (North-East of Sardinia, Italy). Seven soil managements were compared: cork oak forest, pasture under oak trees, open pasture, hay crop under oak trees, open hay crop, grass-covered vineyard and tilled vineyard. Analyses include chemical and spectroscopic (FT-IR) characterization of the humic substances (fulvic acids, humic acids and humin) of the A horizons. Lower amounts of total organic C and humic substances were found in the more disturbed soils such as those of the tilled vineyard, while the other soil managements showed a rather similar pattern for many indices of SOM quality (e.g., HA-C/FA-C, fulvic H/C and humic and fulvic C/N ratios) and for spectroscopic characteristics. These results indicated that the impact of soil management on the humic composition was relatively low for these sub-acid (pH ranging from 5.1 to 6.4) sandy soils under Mediterranean type of climate. The relatively small differences between the forest and the grassland land uses also suggested that the periodical light tillage applied to the grassland did not strongly affect SOM accumulation in the topsoil of this land use. In the oak forest soils, a sharp decrease (-77%) of the organic C from the thin A1 to the A2 horizon was observed, which could constrain the resilience of these soils towards disturbance factors, while the grasslands soils, where the organic C sequestration occurred in a thick horizon, may be more resilient. The compared soil managements revealed to be quite conservative, demonstrating that the traditional agro-silvo-pastoral management practices are effective in maintaining relatively good soil quality traits under semi-arid Mediterranean conditions.

During 3 years, ten grazed wooded grassland fields were studied in the Berchidda-Monti long-term observatory, located in NE Sardinia, Italy, with the aim of exploring the synergies and trade-offs between biodiversity and selected ecosystem services. Positions below and outside the canopy of three cork oak trees in each field were randomly selected to compare seasonal pasture production, pasture utilization rate by animals, botanical composition, biodiversity indicators (Shannon index and plant species richness) and soil organic carbon. In autumn, dry matter production of pasture was similar in the two positions; in two winters out of three it was greater below the trees than outside, and in spring it was greater outside than below the trees. While plant species richness and Shannon index were not significantly influenced by the position, the overall wooded grassland plant species richness was 31% higher than that outside of the tree crown. The soil organic carbon content in the 0-40-cm soil layer was also higher below the trees. Our findings highlight that if the main purpose of the wooded grasslands is to provide forage for grazing animals rather than conserving and/or enhancing plant diversity and soil fertility, the presence of trees constrains the overall forage productivity, although the greater forage availability in winter under the trees can contribute to improve the seasonal distribution of forage production."	92	4	271-275		Italy	Sardinia	40.47	9.1	Unclear		Dehesa/Montado		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Mixed results (positive and negative)	Soil organic carbon		Positive					Scott2006_330	Journal Article	2006	"Scott, N.

Don in New Zealand has led to the establishment of over 600 000 ha of new plantation forests, about 85% of which are on fertile pastures used previously for grazing sheep and cattle. While this leads to rapid accumulation of carbon ( C) in vegetation, the effects of afforestation on soil C are poorly understood. We examined key soil C cycling processes at the ( former) Tikitere agroforestry experimental site near Rotorua, New Zealand. In 1973, replicated stands of P. radiata ( 100 and 400 stems/ha) were established on pastures, while replicated pasture plots were maintained throughout the first 26-year rotation. In 1996, soil C and microbial biomass C in 0 - 0.10 m depth soil, in situ soil respiration and net N mineralisation, and soil temperature were lower in the forest than in the pasture, and tended to decline with increasing tree-stocking density. In the 400 stems/ha stands, mineral soil C ( 0 - 0.50m depth) was lower than in the pasture ( 104 and 126 Mg C/ha, respectively; P< 0.01). Carbon accumulation in the forest floor during the first rotation of these forest stands was 12 Mg C/ha. Using the Rothamsted soil C model (Roth-C), we examined how changes in plant C inputs following afforestation might lead to changes in soil C content to 0.30 m depth. Steady-state pasture inputs of 9.0 Mg C/ha. year were estimated using Roth-C; these C inputs were assumed to decrease linearly during the first 12 years following tree establishment ( until canopy closure). Below-ground C inputs in the forest were estimated using steady-state relationships between litterfall and soil respiration; these inputs were assumed to increase linearly between years 1 and 12, after which they remained constant at 1.53 Mg C/ha. year until harvest. Measured changes in soil C (0-0.30 m) during the first rotation, in conjunction with the below-ground inputs, were used to estimate above-ground inputs ( as a proportion of total litterfall [3.81 Mg C/ha. year]) to the soil. Our results suggest 10% of litterfall C over one rotation actually entered the mineral soil. Using these results and estimates of additional C inputs to the soil from harvest slash and weeds following harvest, we found mineral-soil C stocks would continue to decline during second and third rotations of P. radiata; the magnitude of this decline depended in part on how much slash enters the mineral soil matrix. We confirmed our modelling approach by simulating soil C changes to within 8% over 19 years following afforestation of pasture at another previously studied site, Purukohukohu. Whether afforestation leads to an increase or decrease in mineral-soil C may depend on previous pasture management; in highly productive pastures, high C inputs to the soil may maintain soil C at levels that cannot be sustained when trees are planted onto these grasslands."	44	2	3-4		New Zealand		-38.9	175.84	Unclear		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees					Soil organic carbon		Negative					Schnabel2013_341	Journal Article	2013	"Schnabel, S.; Pulido-Fernandez, M.; Lavado-Contador, J.

Field work was conducted in September 2009 in 22 environmental units belonging to 10 farms, distributed throughout the region of Extremadura. The Molarity of an Ethanol Droplet (MED) method was used for measuring water repellency of the soil surface. A total of 725 points were sampled and the study was combined with a detailed vegetation survey, the determination of soil properties and of land use and management characteristics. More than 70% of the measurement points were hydrophilic, however differences between farm units were found. The highest values of hydrophobicity were observed on soil surfaces below the canopy of holm oaks, as compared to the low values found below shrub canopies (Retama sphaerocarpa) and in open areas. With respect to ground cover, water repellency was highest at sites covered by holm oak litter. At soil surfaces covered by cork oak litter, dry grass and mosses the degree of repellency was lower. Almost all sites with a bare soil surface were hydrophilic, independent of whether these were located below a tree canopy or in open areas. A significant positive relationship between livestock density and the degree of bare soil existed, and consequently, areas with high animal numbers were dominantly hydrophilic.

The objective was to identify optimum combinations of tree belts and pasture for sustainable livestock production and the prevention of secondary salinisation. Treatments were annual pasture, in competition with trees at different orientations (east, west and south), kikuyu pasture in competition with trees at one orientation (west), compared with pasture in the absence of tree competition. Plots had 0, 20 or 36% of their area within 10 m of the tree belt where tree-pasture competition would be expected. Plots (0.48 ha) were stocked with Merino wether hoggets at 12 DSE/ha on annual pastures and 14 DSE/ha on kikuyu pastures. Additional sheep were placed on plots in spring and the annual pasture was destocked in autumn. Within the growing season, herbage mass was similar across both control treatments as a result of varying stock numbers. However, in summer and autumn the kikuyu control contained between 350 and 4900 kg DM/ha more herbage than the corresponding annual pasture. While both pastures accumulated similar amounts of herbage in 1998 and 2000, kikuyu accumulated more in 1999 (11900 v. 9800 kg DM/ha) as a result of summer rain. Competition from tree belts significantly reduced adjacent annual pasture herbage accumulation (16% average reduction), although there was no difference among the levels of competition. Trees did not significantly affect adjacent kikuyu pasture herbage accumulation. Both carrying capacity and clean wool production per hectare were significantly higher on kikuyu pasture in 1999 and 2000. Tree competition also significantly reduced the carrying capacity of neighbouring annual and kikuyu pasture by an average of 10%. Clean wool production per hectare was significantly lower on annual pasture in combination with trees (11% reduction on average), but there was less effect of competition on kikuyu pasture. The kikuyu pasture used 115, 57 and 132 mm more water than the annual pasture in 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. The soil water deficit beneath the trees exceeded that below both control pastures by between 297 and 442 mm. Although the addition of tree belts to annual pasture provided substantial reductions in groundwater recharge, producers would also have to accept losses in livestock production. While kikuyu alone provided significant increases in livestock production and substantial reductions in groundwater recharge, the best compromise was kikuyu in combination with tree belts."	43	07-Aug	68-70		Australia		-33.54	117.49	Sheep		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Decrease with increased tree density/cover/proximity								Sandoiu2014_367	Journal Article	2014	"Sandoiu, I.; Cojocariu, L."

Both are agroforestry systems in which domestic stock are pastured: amongst parklike trees in dehesa, and in enclosures surrounded by stone walls and woody vegetation in hedged fields. The latter are now tending to be replaced by dehesa due to labour costs. Here, we investigate the boundary layer microclimate and environmental characteristics of these two land uses in order to evaluate the respective differences in relation to climate modification, soil organic carbon, and soil water content. Fraxinus angustifolia-dominated sites were investigated in the Guadarrama mountains, Spain, in high summer with simultaneous sampling under trees in both dehesa and hedgerows and in adjacent open fields. Whilst temperature profiles were similar in both systems, hedgerows had higher soil water content, lower wind speeds, and higher total soil organic carbon compared to dehesa, and moreover these trends also applied to open fields of the respective systems. We conclude that not only do hedged fields have advantages over dehesa for shelter and production, but that the climatic modifications of hedged field systems potentially modify boundary layer climates on a broader scale than both individual fields and dehesa. Thus, the conservation of hedged field systems provides natural capital and broad environmental gains. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Krasser) have been transformed into grasslands over the past few decades. In Chile's Aysen region, grazing in remnant forests is common practice but there is little empirical evidence of tree-understorey interactions therein. In an attempt to establish a scientific basis for silvopastoral implementation, the relationship between lenga cover and grassland productivity, quality and species richness was examined. Tree cover was quantified in 14 (20 x 20 m) sites where aboveground herbaceous biomass was evaluated monthly throughout two growing seasons. Herbage quality and plant species richness were measured once at the peak of biomass production in the second year. We discuss radiation transmitted through the canopy and water supply as drivers of the tree-understorey relationship. Changes in herbaceous species composition and richness with varying tree cover are described. Despite interannual differences, scattered trees or medium-density forests allow higher productivity than open areas, as well as an acceptable nutritive value and preservation of native species. Although further studies are required, our results suggest that presence of lenga trees within grazing areas can be an advantageous alternative in terms of biodiversity and productivity, to traditional grazing systems in open grasslands.

At each site, one transect of 80 m long (40 m in open grassland and 40 m in forest) x 10 m wide was established. ANPP was significantly higher in open grasslands but no gradual change in biomass production was observed from inside the forest towards the open grassland. In open grasslands ANPP was spatially uniform but highly variable between years of contrasting weather conditions, whereas in forests it was more spatially heterogeneous and less variable over time. ANPP was highly correlated with cattle consumption. Structural equation models developed for the whole system confirm that ANPP was driven mainly by photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and available nitrogen. However, we found important differences between forests and the adjacent open grasslands. In forests ANPP was enhanced by positive feedbacks between the amount of transmitted PAR through the canopy and soil nutrient input via cattle dung deposition. In open grasslands nitrogen availability appeared to be the main limiting factor but also influenced by weather conditions (dryer or wetter years). The coexistence of forests and grasslands patches, with different susceptibility of ANPP to meteorological and soil nutrient availability, highlights the importance of implementing an integrated silvopastoral system with lenga (Nothofagus pumilio [Poepp. & Endl.] Krasser) in northern Patagonia."	88	3	xviii-pp	agroforestry systems; biomass production; dry season; forests; grasslands; grazing; meteorological factors; net primary production; nitrogen; nutrient availability; photosynthesis; photosynthetically active radiation; silvopastoral systems; soil fertility; temperate zones; weather; wet season	Chile		-45.58	-72.08	Cattle		Forest grazing		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Negative								Salis2017_379	Journal Article	2017	"Salis, L.; Bagella, S.; Roggero, P.

Agroforestry resulted in a 15-25% decline in soil organic C and N compared with grassland, and had a significant negative influence on soil microbial biomass. There was less microbial C and N in soils under 50-400 stems/ha of P. radiata than in soils under grassland (0 stems/ha). Soil carbon decomposition and microbial activity were measured by trapping the carbon dioxide produced by incubating soils over a 60-week period. The results showed that soil C decomposition rates were similar to1.5 times as much (c. 15 mg CO2-C/kg soil) in soil from grassland as in that from plots with 50 or100 stems/ha (c. 10 mg CO2-C/kg soil), and were further reduced to one half (c. 5.5 mg CO2-C/kg soil) in the plots with 200 or 400 stems/ha. The soils under P. radiata gave off less carbon dioxide per unit of biomass (the metabolic quotient) than soils under grassland. These shifts in microbial biomass and its metabolic quotients appear to be associated with differences in the quantity and 'quality' of inputs and soil organic matter decomposition rates, and to reflect the land use change from grassland to forest. Given the general ability of soil microbial biomass to recolonise depopulated areas after tree harvest, we see no problem in restoring populations of these soil organisms vital in controlling nutrient cycling after tree felling, provided adequate adjustments to soil pH are made."	39	3	390-395		New Zealand		-38.9	175.84	Sheep		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees					Soil organic carbon		Negative					Rundle2002_389	Journal Article	2002	"Rundle, P.

When the present owners of the farm took over the property in 1975, the stream running through the farm was becoming saline and access to the lower portions of the farm was frequently hindered by water logging in the wet winter months. The paper describes the decision made by the present owners to develop a whole farm plan to ameliorate water logging and prevent the development of secondary salinity, The plan included the grading of interceptor drains with a fall of 1:300 along the contour 150-200 m apart down the slope and the locating of dams along the drains to hold water for the dry summer months. Belts of three or four species of trees were planted on the down-slope side of the drains after leveling the spoil from the drain and deep-ripping the soil. The benefits of this plan included reduced water logging, salinity and wind erosion, and increased yields, stocking rates and lambing percentages. While the costs of the drains, trees and fencing were about US$ 2760 (US$ 1 = AU$ 1.7, June 2000) per km, gross margins have increased by about US$ 2.70 ha(-1) per year as a result of increases in cereal yields from 2.2 to 3.2 t ha(-1). increased carrying capacity of the pastures from 8.5 to 11.0 dry sheep equivalents (DSE) ha(-1), increased lambing percentages from 77 to 86% and increased income from aquaculture (fresh-water crustaceans) produced in the farm dams.

The trees were grown in lysimeters (1.8 m diameter, 1.0 m depth), and a bare soil treatment was used as a control. The application of dairy-farm oxidation-pond effluent totalled 218 g N/lysimeter (equivalent to 870 kg N/ha) over 2 irrigation seasons (December 1995-June 1996 and September 1996-April 1997). Effluent was applied weekly in summer at a rate of 18.9 mm/week. No effluent was applied during the winter period. The evapotranspiration (ET) rates of the trees, and the volumes and nitrogen contents of the leachates are compared for a winter period (4 weeks) and a summer period (5 weeks). The biomass accumulation and the uptake of nitrogen by the 3 tree species were also investigated. The SRF trees improved the renovation levels of dairy-farm effluent and produced biomass suitable for energy conversion. Of the 3 tree species, only the S. kinuyanagi treatments maintained leachate nitrate concentrations below the New Zealand drinking water standard of 11.3 mg NO3--N/L throughout both the winter and summer periods. The E. nitens treatment produced significantly more oven-dry biomass (19.1 kg/tree) than the E. saligna trees (9.7 kg/tree) (P = 0.05). The S. kinuyanagi treatment had intermediate production (13.3 kg/tree) and was not significantly different from the other 2 tree species (P = 0.05).

In this study we performed a model-based ex-ante analysis of the impact of agroforestry implementation on the economic and environmental performance of two existing farms in The Netherlands. At the field level, we show that two out of three of the designed agroforestry configurations (AFCs) outperformed the monoculture crops (triticale and pasture), resulting in higher financial margin and organic matter balance.

Don in 1973. Measurements made in 1991 and 1992 showed that after 18 years soil pH had declined and that Olsen phosphorus levels increased with increased tree stocking. Soil magnesium also declined at the higher tree stocking rates. We made further measurements on samples collected in 1991 and 1992 to determine reasons for the change in nutrient status. Soil carbon and soil organic phosphorus in the surface soil (0-75 mm depth) decreased with tree stocking, indicating increased net mineralisation of soil organic matter under P. radiata compared with pasture. Exchangeable cations and cation exchange capacity also declined with tree stocking, which is consistent with the loss of exchange sites in soil organic matter. Total soil inorganic phosphorus declined with increased tree stocking. This was expected because of reduced fertiliser phosphorus input at the higher stocking rates. However, phosphorus fractionation showed that bicarbonate-extractable inorganic phosphorus increased and acid-extractable inorganic phosphorus declined with tree stocking. The latter indicated possible decreases in soil apatite phosphorus. These results were consistent with the mobilisation of soil phosphorus under P. radiata by dissolution of fluorapatite (in parent material deposited during the 1886 Tarawera eruption) due to lower soil pH values and mineralisation of organic phosphorus previously accumulated under pasture. Consequently, Olsen phosphorus has increased despite reduced phosphorus fertiliser applications. Microbiological activity (as indicated by microbial biomass and microbial respiration) and phosphatase activities of soil samples collected in 1995 also decreased with tree stocking, and so mineralisation of organic matter was not a result of microbial activity alone. However, the proportion of soil aggregates > 0.5 mm decreased under P. radiata, indicating there was less physical protection of the soil organic matter than under pasture where soil aggregates were maintained by fine roots."	29	1	1004-1006		New Zealand		-40.900557	174.885971	Sheep		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees					Soil organic carbon		Negative					Peri2001_568	Journal Article	2001	"Peri, P.

Cocksfoot and lucerne productivity in a Pinus radiata silvopastoral system: a grazed comparison	Proceedings of the New Zealand Grassland Association	0369-3902			"Plant and animal production from cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata) pasture and lucerne (Medicago sativa) under 10-11 year-old radiata pine trees (Pinus radiata) (200 stems/ha) and from adjacent open pastures (without trees) were measured from the Lincoln University Silvopastoral Experiment, Canterbury, New Zealand. Light intensity under trees was 50-60% of the open pasture. Liveweight gain (LWG) from lucerne was 220 g/hd per day in the open and 158 g/hd per day under trees. On cocksfoot, LWG was 132 g/hd per day in the open and 100 g/hd per day under trees. When converted to LWG/ha, lamb production from open pastures was double that from shaded pastures for lucerne (5.1 and 2.5 kg/ha per day) and cocksfoot (3.4 and 1.7 kg/ha per day). Lucerne produced 11.2 t DM/ha in the open and 7.9 t DM per ha under trees which was 58 and 76% more than cocksfoot in the open and under trees, respectively. However, from September to November, when soil moisture was non-limiting, the lucerne DM production was 36% lower under tree shade than in the open. In comparison, the reduction was only 20% for cocksfoot, which confirms its greater 'shade tolerance'. The reduced lamb LWG produced from lambs on shaded pastures was attributed to the reduced pre-grazing pasture mass and pasture bulk density, leading to reduced apparent intakes. Crude protein and digestibility values were not influenced by shade, and clover content in cocksfoot pastures were low (<7%). It was concluded that: (i) shaded pastures in silvopastoral systems limited animal production compared with open pastures owing to lower DM production rates which lowered pre-grazing pasture mass and reduced bulk density from the etiolated pasture; (ii) the suitability of species for silvopastoral systems should be assessed from total plant and animal production and species persistence rather than 'shade tolerance', which only examines the relative decline in DM production under shade compared with unshaded situations."	63		21-26	agroforestry systems; animal production; crop production; crude protein; digestibility; dry matter accumulation; grazing; lambs; liveweight gain; lucerne; pastures; pines; productivity; shade; silvopastoral systems; trees; woody plants	New Zealand		-40.900557	174.885971	Sheep		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees		Multiple	Livestock growth AND pasture production	Negative								Peri2007_575	Journal Article	2007	"Peri, P.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to quantify the dry matter (DM) production, sward morphology, crude protein (CP%), organic matter digestibility (OMD) and macro-nutrient concentrations (P, K, Mg, Ca and S) in a grazed cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata L.) pasture under 10-year-old Pinus radiata D. Don forest. Four levels of light intensity were compared: full sunlight (100% photosynthetic photon flux density-PPFD), open + wooden slats (similar to 43% PPFD), trees (similar to 58% PPFD) and tree + slats (similar to 24% PPFD). The mean total DM production was 8.2 t DM ha(-1) yr(-1) in the open and 3.8 t DM ha(-1) yr(-1) in the trees + slats treatment. The changes in cocksfoot leaf area index (LAI) were related to variations in morphological aspects of the sward such as canopy height and tiller population. CP% increased as PPFD declined with mean values of 18.6% in open and 22.5% in the trees + slats treatment. In contrast, the intensity of fluctuating shade had little effect on OMD with a mean value of 79 +/- 3.2%. The mean annual macro-nutrient concentrations in leaves increased as the PPFD level declined mainly between the open and the trees + slats treatments. It therefore appears that heavily shaded dominant temperate pastures in silvopastoral systems limit animal production per hectare through lower DM production rates and per animal through reduced pre-grazing pasture mass of lower bulk density from the etiolated pasture."	70	1	167-171		New Zealand		-40.900557	174.885971	Pasture without livestock		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Negative								Pent2019_602	Journal Article	2019	"Pent, Gabriel J.; Fike, John H."

This study compared lamb performance in honeylocust (cv. Millwood) and black walnut (Juglans nigra) silvopastures with productivity on open pastures during a six week winter grazing trial. Treatment pastures were rotationally stocked with three (walnut) or six (honeylocust and open) lambs per experimental unit based on forage availability.

Our objective was to examine the effects of these land uses on the activities of selected enzymes (beta-glucosidase, beta-glucosaminidase, fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolase, and dehydrogenase), proportion of water stable aggregates (WSA), soil organic carbon and total nitrogen content. Four management treatments [grazed pasture (GP), agroforestry buffer (AgB), grass buffer (GB) and row crop (RC)] were sampled in 2009 and 2010 at two depths (0 to 10- and 10 to 20-cm) and analyzed. Most of the soil quality indicators were significantly greater under perennial vegetation when compared to row crop treatments. Although there were numerical variations, soil quality response trends were consistent between years. The beta-glucosaminidase activity increased slightly from 156 to 177 mu g PNP g(-1) dry soil while beta-glucosidase activity slightly decreased from 248 to 237 mu g PNP g(-1) dry soil in GB treatment during 2 years. The surface (0-10 cm depth) had greater enzyme activities and WSA than sub-surface (10-20 cm) samples. WSA increased from 178 to 314 g kg(-1) in row crop areas while all other treatments had similar values during the 2 year study. The treatment by depth interaction was significant (P < 0.05) for beta-glucosidase and beta-glucosaminidase enzymes in 2009 and for dehydrogenase and beta-glucosaminidase in 2010. Soil enzyme activities were significantly correlated with soil organic carbon content (r a parts per thousand yen 0.94, P < 0.0001). This is important because soil enzyme activities and microbial biomass can be enhanced by perennial vegetation and thus improve several other soil quality parameters. These results also support the hypothesis that positive interactions among management practices, soil biota and subsequent environmental quality effects are of great agricultural and ecological importance."	84	2	43-54		USA	Missouri	37.2	-92.74	Cattle		Riparian strip		Pasture without trees					Soil organic carbon		No effect					Pasalodos-Tato2009_631	Journal Article	2009	"Pasalodos-Tato, Maria; Pukkala, Timo; Rigueiro-Rodriguez, Antonio; Fernanez-Nunez, Esther; Rosa Mosquera-Losada, Maria"	Optimal Management of Pinus radiata Silvopastoral Systems Established on Abandoned Agricultural Land in Galicia (North-Western Spain)	Silva Fennica	0037-5330	10.14214/sf.176	<Go to ISI>://WOS:000273665200009	"Timber production has been the main objective in forest production in Galicia for a long time. Nevertheless, factors such as fire risk and the need to obtain non-timber benefits make other production alternatives like silvopastoral systems worth of consideration. Integration of grazing in the production system not only diversifies products and benefits, but also decreases fire risk by enhancing fuel control. Nonetheless, few Studies have examined the economic profitability of these systems. This article analyses the economics of silvopastoral systems established on abandoned agricultural soils afforested with Pinus radiata D. Don. Different tree planting, densities, discounting rates, grass values and fire risk scenarios were analysed. The technique employed is based on the combination of an optimization algorithm and a simulator of stand growth and grass yield. The most profitable schedules were obtained with initial stand densities of 1500 trees per hectare. However, with high unit values of pasture production (high value of grass), schedules with an initial stand density of 500 trees per hectare were the most profitable. When the risk of fire was included in the analyses, silvopastoral systems were always more profitable than timber production systems. With an assumption that grazing reduces fire risk thinnings should be done earlier and heavier to reduce the expected losses due to fire and to promote grass production. This lengthens the pasture period. In general, rotation lengths of silvopastoral systems were shorter than in timber production."	43	5	769-773		Spain	Galicia	42.5	-8.1	Sheep		Silvopasture		Forest without grazing												PositiveParminter2001_634	Journal Article	2001	"Parminter, I.; Dodd, M.

In a 17-year-old Pinus pinaster Aiton plantation, established at a density of 1200 trees ha-1 in a semi-arid mediterranean environment of Macedonia, Greece, three degrees of thinning (control, 50% and 75% of trees removed), two levels of fertilisation (control and 1000 kg ha-1 of NPK fertiliser), and two grazing intensities (control and 0.8 sheep ha-1 year-1) were applied. All stands were seeded with 30 kg ha-1 of Dactylis glomerata L. seed. Measurements included cover and species composition, herbage production and nutrient content of the understory vegetation for three consecutive growing seasons. It was found that thinning and fertilisation significantly increased vegetative cover and herbage production by favouring the establishment of the seeded grass as well as other spontaneous species while a significant interaction also appeared between them. Grazing, however, significantly reduced understory vegetation. Applied nutrients were reduced by thinning and grazing while other nutrients such as Ca, Mg and Na were not affected by any treatment. It is concluded that thinning of dense P. pinaster stands up to 300 trees ha-1 and seeding palatable range grasses substantially improves grazing conditions for sheep. This improvement becomes impressive with NPK fertilisation, which increases herbage production and ameliorates its nutrient content even under fairly dense pine stands.

This paper focuses on the integration of understorey crops and/or livestock within high value tree systems (e.g., apple orchards, olive groves, chestnut woodlands, and walnut plantations), and describes the components, structure, ecosystem services and economic value of ten case studies of this type of agroforestry across Europe. Although their ecological and socio-economic contexts vary, the systems share some common characteristics. The primary objective of the farmer is likely to remain the value of tree products like apples, olives, oranges, or nuts, or particularly high value timber. However there can still be production, environmental or economic benefits of integrating agricultural crops such as chickpeas and barley, or grazing an understorey grass crop with livestock. Three of the systems focused on the grazing of apple orchards with sheep in the UK and France. The introduction of sheep to apple orchards can minimise the need for mowing and provide an additional source of revenue. Throughout the Mediterranean, there is a need to improve the financial viability of olive groves. The case studies illustrate the possibility of intercropping traditional olive stands with chickpea in Greece, or the intercropping of wild asparagus in high density olive groves in Italy. Another system studied in Greece involves orange trees intercropped with chickpeas. Stands of chestnut trees in North-west Spain can provide feed for pigs when the fruit falls in November, and provide an excellent habitat for the commercial production of edible mushrooms. In Spain, in the production of high quality walnut trees using rotations of up to 50-60 years, there are options to establish a legume-based mixed pasture understorey and to introduce sheep to provide financial and environmental benefits."	92	4	147-156		UK		55.378051	-3.435973	Sheep		Orchard		Other	Orchard without grazing											PositiveOvalle2006_669	Journal Article	2006	"Ovalle, Carlos; Del Pozo, Alejandro; Casado, Miguel A.; Acosta, Belen; de Miguel, Jose M."

The effects of landscape heterogeneity on the diversity and productivity of herbaceous plant communities were studied in 29 plots of 1000 m(2), with a wide range of woody cover. A detrended correspondence analysis of the species x plots matrix explained 73% of the total variation and revealed the existence of two trends of variation in floristic composition: one associated with physiographic position (hillsides and flatlands) and the other related to the number of years since the last cutting, or coppicing, of A. caven. Despite the great majority of the original herbaceous species having disappeared as a result of the prevailing land use system, some native species have been able to survive especially on hillside areas with low grazing intensity. Woody cover was a good indicator of spatial heterogeneity and land use history. It was also correlated with stocking rate, above-ground biomass of herbaceous vegetation, and soil fertility (organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus concentration), both on hillsides and flatlands. The relationship between woody cover and herbaceous plant species richness was significant and unimodal in flat land areas, and linear, and marginally significant, on hillsides.

Our objective was to investigate how understory plant communities and soil physical and chemical properties respond during the first 2 years following conversion of northern hardwood forest to pasture. To accomplish this, we established three forest conversion treatments (silvopasture, open pasture, and woodlot) in a 50 year old northern hardwood forest in New York. The silvopasture and open pasture treatments were seeded with forages and then grazed with cattle after the initial timber harvest. Understory plant inventories and soil sampling were conducted pre-treatment and 2 years after treatment establishment. Understory non-woody plant species richness increased in all treatments during the two year period (F = 73.633, P < 0.001), while species richness of understory woody plants remained similar to pretreatment levels (F = 2.648, P = 0.150). Species most negatively affected by forest conversion included Arisaema triphyllum, Mitchella repens, and Thalictrum pubescens. Species that were only observed after the treatments were established included Danthonia spicata, Agrostis spp., Ranunculus spp., Digitaria spp., Rumex acetosella, and Hieracium spp. One species, Vaccinium angustifolium, was negatively affected by the silvopasture and open pasture treatments, but not the woodlot treatment. Soil bulk density was higher in both the open and silvopasture treatments compared to pretreatment levels, but the woodlot treatment soil bulk density remained statistically similar to pre-treatment levels. Percent total nitrogen, potentially mineralizable nitrogen, and phosphorus increased in silvopastures, open pastures, and woodlot treatment groups compared to pre-treatment levels.

Unfortunately, little quantitative data exist regarding forage performance and economic outcomes associated with different forest-to-agriculture conversion strategies, particularly for the northern tier of states. This research examined forage dry matter production and quality in six forage treatments (orchardgrass, bluegrass, brome, and perennial ryegrass bicultures with white clover; cut hay; and a control) in newly-established silvopastures and open pastures converted from an early successional northern hardwood forest in New York. In addition, we conducted a financial analysis of the establishment of both agricultural systems, as well as a thinned forest treatment managed solely for wood products. Total forage dry matter production (planted forages plus volunteer grasses) was greater in open pastures than silvopastures in the first year after establishment; however, no differences in total forage production were found between silvopastures and open pastures in June or August of the second year. Total forage dry matter production was greater in the orchardgrass-white clover biculture compared to the control treatment in both years. Orchardgrass percent crude protein was lower in open pastures (10.7%) compared to silvopastures (12.9%) in June of year two. The financial analysis indicated that silvopasture outperformed open pasture and thinned forest treatments in terms of both IRR and NPV. We conclude that forage production in silvopastures can be competitive with that in open pastures on sites with a similar, forested, starting condition."	93	1	37-43		USA	New York	44.35	-73.53	Cattle		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		No effect								PositiveOosterbaan2006_693	Journal Article	2006	"Oosterbaan, A.; Schepers, H.; Kwanten, E."

The cultivars that performed best in these trials originated from British Columbia ('Broadview') and The Netherlands ('Buccaneer'). In an agroforestry project in the East, 8 farms planted 10 ha of walnut ('Broadview', 'Buccaneer'), cherry and sweet chestnut at a spacing between 10-20 metres. The initial investment for trees, poles, wire netting to protect against animals, resulted in a low net income for the first 5 years. Thereafter, the income from the combination of walnut and quality timber with grass is reasonable and may exceed the income from subsidised, extensively managed grass. The grass production varied from 3 to 9 tons of dry matter per hectare per year. In the 4 years of investigation there was no visible evidence that the presence of the trees had influenced the composition and production of the grass vegetation. Based on predicted crown development grass production will be possible for a long period. So far, the nut production from the young plantations has not been profitable. In order to find walnuts that were better adapted to the cooler weather conditions of the North, walnuts were selected from green areas in the North and evaluated for their characteristics. This resulted in at least two cultivars ('Dionym', 'Amphyon') with excellent yield potentials together with a good external and internal quality. Both cultivars have a low susceptibility to disease and are particularly suitable for organic cultivation. 'Dionym' and 'Amphyon' are planted in private gardens but also in a commercial organic orchard of 1.5 ha in which the 200 walnut trees are grown together (mixed cropping) with hazelnuts and Sea Buckthorn."		705	438	agroforestry; dry matter; grasslands; hazelnuts; organic farming; sown grasslands; walnuts	Netherlands		52.132633	5.291266	Unclear		Silvopasture		Baseline from implementation		Understory/pasture production		No effect								Mixed results (positive and no effect)Olson2000_696	Journal Article	2000	"Olson, B.

In Winter 1 (1966-1997), backfat thickness increased on windbreak and non-windbreak cattle. Body condition scores of both groups were lower at the end of the trial. In Winter 2 (1997-1998), backfat thickness decreased for windbreak and non-windbreak cattle. Body condition scores did not change. Weight changes were minor both winters. Changes in backfat thickness indicated that cattle in Winter 1 were catabolizing more lean muscle tissue, whereas cattle in Winter 2 were catabolizing more fat. Cattle entered Winter 1 in lower body condition and mass than in Winter 2. Cattle with access to windbreaks tended to have a stronger cell-mediated immune response than non-windbreak cattle.

Although alternative tools to increase forage availability during critical seasons exists, most of them are unaffordable and short-lived in marginal areas. We explore the potential benefits of deciduous tree plantations favoring winter forage productivity by comparing aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) patterns in herbaceous understory to tree plantations and natural grasslands in the Pampas (Argentina). These temperate subhumid grasslands are characterized by the coexistence of winter species, mainly C3 grasses of the native genera Stipa, Piptochaetium, and Bromus and the exotic genera Lolium and Festuca) and summer species (mainly C4 grasses of the native genera Paspalum, Bothriochloa, and Stenotaphrum) that replace each other throughout the seasons, with domination of the latter. We hypothesize that the natural decoupling of growing seasons between winter deciduous trees and winter grasses could provide the basis for the sustainable promotion of winter forage. We measured ANPP on two 23-year-old Populus deltoides plantations and their understory and compared them with adjacent open grasslands. Afforested stands had 55-75% higher annual ANPP than their non-afforested neighbors, with trees contributing similar to 70% to total ANPP. Herbaceous canopies beneath plantations achieved about half of the ANPP observed in non-afforested situations with a contrasting seasonal distribution associated with shifts from C4 to C3 grass dominance. Winter ANPP, the most critical source of forage in these grazing systems, was similar or higher in the herbaceous understory of tree plantations to that on their non-afforested counterparts, suggesting that mixed systems involving deciduous trees and understory pastures are a valid and viable option in the region."	83	2	84-107		Argentina		-36.09	-57.8	Cattle		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Mixed results (negative and no effect)								Neel2008_759	Journal Article	2008	"Neel, J.

Tree plantation is recognized as a way to reduce nutrient leaching and increase land profitability in agronomic and forest soils, meanwhile pasture fertilization and sowing is usually associated to better pasture productivity and quality. Fertilization can be performed with mineral fertilizers, which have become expensive in recent times, or with organic fertilizers like sludge, which is being promoted worldwide. This study aims to evaluate the effects of sludge fertilization, tree planting and pasture sowing on different variables of soil (KCl-pH, cation exchange capacity, total N, total and Mehlich P, nitrate and soil organic matter) and pasture (production, botanical composition, crude protein and P concentration) in treeless and agroforestry systems established in forest and agronomic soils. The experimental design was a randomized block following an incomplete factorial design with three replicates and nine treatments including two types of soils (forestry and agronomic), two types of vegetation (natural and sown), two types of fertilization (sludge fertilization and mineral fertilization, with a no fertilizer control) in afforested and treeless pastures. Pasture production and quality was better under agronomic soils, which also had higher levels of KCl-pH, cation exchange capacity, nitrate, total N and P than forest soils. Tree establishment did not modify nitrate or P leaching, probably due to the youth of the trees when most of nitrate was leached at the beginning of the experiment, but reduction of soil KCl pH and pasture crude protein was found in forest soils, when trees and pasture were together established, probably due to the high extractions of these systems compared with unsown forests. Moreover, the sludge inputs increased pasture production better than the mineral fertilizer in the forest soils, probably due to the greater amount of nutrients applied by the former. Sowing enhanced the presence of sown grasses in the forest understory, but their presence reduced pasture quality, and they disappeared within a short period of time.

Participative research to assess public benefits (including biodiversity) and uptake by the industry was also carried out. Results showed that with the exception of the slow rate of woodland establishment, results exceeded predictions, especially for the combined system economics, where actual returns were 20% more than predicted. The public and the industry were also very supportive of such an approach (78% and 68% of them respectively). It could also be argued that there is the potential to fully integrate the system in the future by grazing within the woodland and increased use for recreation and amenity, providing evidence that such a multiple land use approach is a viable one for upland and hill areas."	6	2	96-101		UK	Scotland	56.39	-3.44	Sheep		Farm woodland		Baseline from implementation		Livestock growth		Positive								PositiveMoreno2005_817	Journal Article	2005	"Moreno, G.; Obrador, J.; Garcia, E.; Cubera, E.; Montero, M.

Riparian buffers were identified as a tool available to farmers and catchment managers to achieve water quality improvements. This study compares 10 in wide regenerating grass and Eucalyptus globulus buffer performance. Surface and subsurface water quality were monitored over a 3-year period. Nutrient and sediment transport were both dominated by subsurface flow, in particular through the B-horizon. and this may seriously limit the surface-runoff-related functions of the riparian buffers. Riparian buffer trapping efficiencies were variable on an event basis and annual basis. The grass buffer reduced total phosphorus, filterable reactive phosphorus. total nitrogen and suspended sediment loads from surface runoff by 50 to 60%. The E. globulus buffer was not as effective. and total load reductions in surface runoff ranged between 10 and 40%. A key difference between the grass and E. globulus buffers was the seasonality of sediment and nutrient transport. Surface runoff. and therefore sediment and nutrient transport. occurred throughout the year in the E. globulus buffer. but only during the winter in the grass buffer. As a consequence of high summer nutrient and sediment concentrations. half the annual loads moving, via surface runoff pathways through the E. globulus buffer were transported during intense summer storm. This Study demonstrates that grass and E. globulus riparian buffers receiving runoff from pasture under natural rainfall can reduce sediment and nutrient loads from surface runoff. However, in this environment the B-horizon Subsurface flow is the dominant flowpath for nutrient transport through the riparian buffers, and this subsurface flow pathway carries contaminant loads at least three times greater than surface runoff.

Dense Callitris glaucophylla ( Joy Thomps. & L. A. S.

We investigated soil chemical and groundcover patterns associated with individual small and large C. glaucophylla trees at six sites of variable management history and lithology in NWNSW, Australia. We posed two questions: ( 1) do individual C. glaucophylla trees impose patterns on soil and groundcover ( soil extractable P, C, N, Sand pH, litter biomass, litter P and pasture cover), and, ( 2) if patterns exist, do they differ between tree sizes? Results showed that extractable P, C and pH decreased away from trees of both sizes, but significantly higher values were recorded adjacent to the stem of large trees. Litter biomass exhibited a strong site-related trend independent of soil variables. Positive correlations between litter and soil variables existed for some sites and not others, indicative of processes such as grazing which contribute to the transport of litter away from the tree. Irrespective of tree size ground-storey vegetation cover increased significantly away from the stem, presumably as a consequence of competition for soil water. Further results indicated that single C. glaucophylla trees enrich soils in patterns analogous to other species in similar environments worldwide. However, localised soil improvements must be weighed up against the negative effects of decreased groundcover associated with trees, and the potential for the species to re-seed prolifically into managed paddocks. Future research will discern the impact of individual C. glaucophylla trees at higher densities, where soil patterning may be modified by intense within-stand competition."	31	3	93-100		Australia	New South Wales	-30.05	142.66	Mixture of sheep and cattle		Wood pasture		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Decrease with increased tree density/cover/proximity	Total soil carbon		Positive					McCreary2001_919	Journal Article	2001	"McCreary, D."

The treatments were: conventional soil tillage (CT); no tillage with permanent spontaneous herbaceous vegetation cover (NV); no tillage with permanent rainfed seeded pasture cover (NP); and as NP but with irrigation (NIP). Production of nuts, forage and edible mushrooms were measured and sustainability was assessed by production and diversity of fungal sporocarps. Annual net income was estimated by the difference between the annual gross outputs (market values for nuts, forage and edible commercial mushrooms) and the annual input costs. The greatest nut and edible mushroom production and sporocarp biodiversity were achieved in the NIP and NV and the smallest in the CT treatment.

Primary aims are to develop understanding of the processes governing flood generation and the associated impacts of land management practices, and to bridge the gap between process understanding and ability to predict effects on downstream flooding. To achieve this, the experiment is designed to operate at plot (similar to 100 m(2)), hillslope (similar to 0.1 km(2)) and small catchment scale (similar to 10 km(2)). Hillslope-scale data, from an under-drained, agriculturally 'improved' Pasture. show that drain flow is a dominant runoff process. However, depending on antecedent moisture conditions. overland flow may exceed drain flow rates and can be an important contributor to peak flow runoff at the hillslope-scale. Flow, soil tension data and tracer tests confirm the importance of macropores and presence of perched water tables under 'normal' wet conditions. Comparisons of pasture runoff with that from within a 10 year-old tree shelterbelt show significantly reduced overland flow due to the presence of trees and/or absence of sheep. Comparisons of soil hydraulic properties show significant increases in hydraulic conductivity and saturated moisture content of soil under trees compared to adjacent improved pasture.

At each site, three plots were established where surface runoff was measured, supplemented by measurements of soil infiltration rates and soil and vegetation physical properties. Following baseline monitoring, treatments were applied to two of the plots: exclusion of sheep (ungrazed) and exclusion of sheep and planting with native broadleaf tree species (tree planted), with the third plot acting as a control (grazed pasture). Due to a particularly dry summer that occurred pre-treatment, the soil hydrological responses were initially impacted by the effects of the climate on soil structure. Nevertheless, treatments did have a clear influence on soil hydrological response. On average, post-treatment runoff volumes were reduced by 48% and 78% in ungrazed and tree-planted plots relative to the control, although all results varied greatly over the sites. Five years following treatment application, near-surface soil bulk density was reduced and median soil infiltration rates were 67 times greater in plots planted with trees compared to grazed pasture. The results illustrate the potential use of upland land management for ameliorating local-scale flood generation but emphasise the need for long-term monitoring to more clearly separate the effects of land management from those of climatic variability.

The region is marked by environmental problems, particularly soil and water salinity, owing to past extensive clearly of indigenous deep-rooted vegetation for agriculture. Agroforestry can be a way to control and ameliorate the problems. The major conclusion is that pine agroforestry can be more profitable in the long term than conventional agriculture. It would be a profitable way to control and ameliorate the environmental problems in the region. It would also generate other benefits. A number of measures can be adopted to reduce or avert any problems arising from agroforestry's annual net returns (which fluctuate and are negative for most years before log sales) and annual labour requirements (which vary over time and are generally higher than those for agriculture for about the first half of the agroforestry rotation). These measures include using a low tree density and converting only part of a farm to agroforestry so that the activity is practised in combination with conventional agriculture.

Factors consisted of cattle being fed in facilities with or without wind barriers and with or without shade. Steers were fed dry-relied corn-based diets (1.43 Mcal/ kg, NEg). Mean starting date and days on feed were June 26 and 79, respectively. I;I unshaded areas, temperature and humidity averaged 21.6 degrees C and 77.9%, and the blackglobe-humidity index (BGHI) at 1500 averaged between 84.0 and 89.1. Each of four 6.1- x 6.1-m structures (mean height = 3.4 m) with white steel roofs provided shade (2.65 m(2)/steer) for two pens. In facilities with wind barriers provided, airflow was reduced from the north and northwest by a 25-m-wide shelterbelt containing six rows of trees. For cattle fed in pens with wind barriers, shade increased(P < .05) gain from 0 to 56 d and decreased (P < .05) DMI/ADG from 0 to 28 d. Differences (P < .05) in performance were not found between shaded and unshaded cattle in any portion of the feeding period for cattle fed in the pens without wind barriers and over the entire feeding period in either type of facility. The shade response in pens with wind barriers seemed to be greater the Ist yr than in subsequent years. Differences in weather patterns among years, especially air temperature, humidity, and solar radiation, may partially explain this interaction. Also, in yr I, cattle tended to have greater fat thickness at finish than in yr 2 and 3. Correlations between BGHI and DMI tended to be greater during the early portion of the trial(0 to 28 d) than over the entire trial. Correlations between the difference in BGHI under shade vs no shade and percentage of shade use had the greatest magnitude and were significant only in the first 28 d vs over the entire feeding period. Although no heat-related cattle deaths occurred in this study, results suggest that shade improves cattle performance in the summer when they are fed in facilities with winter wind protection available and have not become acclimated to hot conditions. Once cattle are acclimated or hot conditions subside, compensation by unshaded cattle offsets much of the initial benefits of providing shade."	77	8	71-79		USA	Midwestern USA	42.48	-93.8	Cattle		Shelterbelt/Windbreak		Pasture without trees		Livestock mortality		Positive								Mader1997_1001	Journal Article	1997	"Mader, T.

A 12-week field study was conducted at the Henfaes Research Station near Bangor, Wales to compare canopy interception, soil water infiltration, and bulk density between a control pasture and two silvopastoral tree planting configurations: trees clumped in fenced-off ungrazed plots and trees planted evenly and grazed. The study's aim was to characterize the potential of these tree planting configurations to reduce local flood risk. Automated throughfall gauges were installed in each silvopastoral treatment along with a similarly designed control gauge located in the grazed control pasture. Soil water infiltration and bulk density were measured 20 times in a stratified random design for each treatment and control. Results showed that the mean soil infiltration capacity in clumped configuration was 504% greater than the control pasture and 454% greater than the even spaced configuration. Average canopy interception was higher in the clumped configuration (34%) than in the even spaced configuration (28%). Soil bulk density was lower in the clumped configuration (0.87Mg/m(3)) than in the control pasture (0.93Mg/m(3)) and even spaced configuration (1Mg/m(3)). Results suggest that silvopastoral systems are more likely to benefit from clumped and ungrazed tree configurations than from evenly-spaced and grazed tree configurations because of enhanced infiltration, lower soil compaction, and increased canopy interception. Our findings support the growing evidence base that fenced-off tree areas in silvopastoral settings can increase infiltration and thus reduce local flood risk.

In Europe, there is growing interest in establishing high quality wood plantations with intensive management comprising irrigation, fertilisation and chemical weed control to reduce rotation length. However, these operations can have major environmental impacts similar to the effects of intensive agriculture, such as impoverishment of soil C. The aim of this study is to identify optimum management practices for intensive systems of quality wood production to optimise soil C stock and plantation productivity. An experiment was conducted in Extremadura, mid-west Spain, from 2011 to 2014, in a 13 year-old hybrid walnut (Juglans major x regia mj 209xra) plantation with a density of 333 trees ha(-1). Two essays were established: one with three techniques to control competition from herbaceous strata beneath trees - mowing, ploughing and sheep grazing (1 sheep ha(-)1)- and the other to test implementation of legumes (mixture of Trifolium michelanium and Ornithopus compressus complemented by the same quantities of phosphorous and potassium as mineral treatment) as an alternative to traditional mineral fertilisation (40 kg N ha(-1), 40 kg P205 ha(-1) and 50 kg K2O ha(-1)). The C stock estimate was based on soil organic carbon (SOC) and aboveground (tree trunks and branches) and belowground biomass (tree and pasture roots). Most of the C stock was contained in SOC, at 50% in the uppermost soil layer (025 cm), followed by aboveground biomass. The response of SOC in each treatment was higher than the other parameters analysed, suggesting that SOC is a more sensitive pool to management techniques. Grazing as control of herbaceous vegetation and legume implementation as nitrogen supply are suitable techniques for optimising soil C stocks and also achieve adequate tree growth in the longer term.

Agroforestry systems including stone pine and agricultural crops (forage oat and potatoes) and sheep grazing for mutton production were tested in two experimental plots located in El Carmen, Biobio region. The plots were evaluated during 5years after planting. Crop yields were lower than the region average, reaching nearly 60% of national average yields of forage oat and 66-86% of potato. Forage production in these plots was not enough to sustain permanent grazing; however, sheep grazing in regulated periods contributes to mutton production. Grazing reduces weed and shrub growth, fire risk and the cost of periodic mechanical cleaning.

In this study, the effects of three different agroforestry systems (hedgerow, shelterbelt, and silvopasture) and their component land-cover types (treed area and adjacent herbland) on SOC stock in LFH and mineral soil layers (0-75 cm) were investigated across 36 sites in central Alberta, Canada. The SOC stock of mineral soil (0-75 cm) was not affected by agroforestry systems but by land-cover type. The treed area had greater (p < 0.001) SOC in the 0-75 cm mineral soil (25.5 kg C m(-2)) than the herbland (19.4 kg C m(-2)), driven by the greater (p < 0.001) SOC level in the top 0-30 cm rather than that in the deeper layers (30-75 cm). Within the treed area, the silvopasture system that was dominated by broad-leaf deciduous trees had 56-70% more SOC in the 0-10 cm soil than in the hedgerow and shelterbelt systems. The SOC stock in the 0-10 cm layer was positively (p = 0.025) related to the C stock of the overlying LFH layer in the silvopasture system. These results together with the 22-24% higher dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration in the silvopasture than in the other systems suggest that the greater SOC stock in the 0-10 cm mineral soil could be attributed to the higher rates of translocation of DOC from the LFH in the silvopasture than that in shelterbelt or hedgerow. We conclude that SOC stock in the top mineral soil (e.g., 0-30 cm) is more responsive to changes in land-cover type and the LFH layer plays an important role in increasing SOC stock in the surface mineral soil of the agroforestry systems in central Alberta."	417		57-65		Canada	Alberta	55.19	-115.12	Unclear		Silvopasture	AND shelterbelt AND hedge	Pasture without trees					Soil organic carbon		Positive					Leninger1984_1103	Journal Article	1984	"Leninger, W.

Cows were equipped with global positioning collars that recorded position, temperature and head movements at 5-min intervals during 6 days in each of four seasons repeated during 2 years. The time animals took to traverse areas of varying diameter revealed patches of 6-9-m diameter in the pastures with low, and 18-21-m diameter in the pastures with high tree canopy cover. In agreement with the current model, crookedness of cow paths had two distinct domains. Within distances of 0-40 m, paths were relatively straight and similar, but from 40 to 200 m, they became increasingly tortuous. Correlation of sequential turning angles identified patches of movement with diameters between 40 and 100 m, which correspond to the 'patch' level of grazing within grazing sites. Seasonal changes in meal patterns were consistent with changes in temperature and forage quality and interacted with the distribution of shade. Thus, spatial distribution of grazing and temporal distribution of meals were inextricably linked. Low forage quality and high temperatures in summer resulted in highly concentrated grazing around trees. Conversely, winter and early spring forages of very high quality and low availability motivated more widely distributed grazing, with low proportion of areas being re-grazed. Resting sites acted as beginning and end of grazing bouts. We conclude that shade distribution can modulate meal start and duration."	55	3	933-960		USA	California	39.16	-121.56	Cattle		Wood pasture		Pasture without trees		Livestock growth		Positive								LaRade2011_1129	Journal Article	2011	"LaRade, Shawna E.; Bork, Edward W."

The aims of the study were 1) to explore the spatial variability associated to the trees for soil C storage and its components and reactivity; and 2) to assess the similarities between microenvironments in terms of microbial functional diversity. Eight microenvironments characterized by different long-term soil management practices and different positions with respect to woody plant canopy soil vertical projections were selected in a Mediterranean agropastoral system. Four management types were considered: pasture, hay crop, grass-covered vineyard, and tilled vineyard. Soil organic C, microbial biomass, and respiration were measured to assess C storage and dynamics, while functional diversity was determined by means of soil enzyme activities. The results showed that the microenvironmental variation of soil organic C and functional microbial diversity generated by the tree canopies in the wooded grassland can be very relevant for an accurate assessment of soil organic C content and its dynamics. The same was not applicable to vineyards, where the spatial variation of both soil organic C and functional diversity was negligible, independently of the soil management practices. These results suggest that in such systems the microscale spatial variability generated by the trees is worth of further investigation for improving our understanding of the long-term management effects on soil C dynamics."	38	1	382-384		Italy	Sardinia	40.78	9.16	Unclear		Dehesa/Montado		Pasture without trees					Soil organic carbon		Positive					Kumar2010_1153	Journal Article	2010	"Kumar, Sandeep; Udawatta, Ranjith P.; Anderson, Stephen H."

Buffers were surrounded by a fence that prevented cattle from grazing within these areas. Soils at the site are Menfro silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Hapludalf). Infiltration rates were measured using ponded ring infiltration units during 2 years for the four (AgB, GB, RP and CP) treatments with three replicates from two subareas within each treatment. Infiltration rate as a function of tension (at 50, 100, and 150 mm) was also measured using a tension infiltrometer. Water infiltration parameters were estimated using Green-Ampt and Parlange infiltration equations. Quasi-steady state infiltration rates (q (s) ) and field-saturated hydraulic conductivity (K (fs) ) for buffers were about 31 and 46 times higher as compared to pasture treatments, respectively. Green-Ampt and Parlange models appeared to fit measured data with r (2) values ranging from 0.91 to 0.98.

The site was winter harvested from November 1988 to March 1989. Cattle grazing was done for one month per year (early June to early July) to achieve 75% utilization of forage vegetation. The experiment was laid out as a split-plot randomized complete block design with three replications and four transects per plot.

Timber harvesting of these aspen stands increased the cover of plant species such as bluejoint reedgrass (Calamagrostis canadensis), northern bedstraw (Galium boreale), tall bluebells (Mertensia paniculata), and sweet coltsfoot (Petasites frigidus) probably as a result of greater light transmission. The cover of young aspen was increased by timber harvesting by over 15 times, while the cover of young balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera) increased by over 200 times. Ten years of cattle grazing did not significantly affect the canopy cover of aspen, but increased the total number of plant species relative to the ungrazed treatments because of enhanced colonization of endemic species.

Lodgepole pine nutrition and growth on grazed forest cutblocks in southern British Columbia	BC Journal of Ecosystems and Management	1488-4666			"Forest grazing occurs on replanted or naturally regenerated cutblocks, giving temporary grazing opportunities for British Columbia's (Canada) beef industry. However, grazing on forest cutblocks sometimes results in conflicts between the different interests of the timber and ranching industries. The forester's primary concern about cattle grazing and forage seeding on cutblocks is tree damage by trampling and browsing, followed by soil compaction and altered tree nutrition. This study evaluated the effect of long-term cattle grazing and forage seeding on growth and nutrition of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) on three grazed forest cutblocks near Kamloops and Merritt, British Columbia, Canada. Grazing regimes consisted of ungrazed exclosures and pastures grazed at 50% forage utilization during 1989-1998. Forage seeding treatments were 0 and 12 kg/ha. Tree measurements and foliage samples were obtained in September 1999. Tree height, current-year growth (length of leader internode), and foliar nutrient levels of regenerating lodgepole pine have not been significantly affected by forage seeding rate and 9 years of cattle grazing. The absence of significant effects on tree growth and nutrition is particularly noteworthy because of the marginal or somewhat deficient status of several nutrients (N, P, B, Fe, and Cu) on these study sites. The management implications of this study relate to the benign effects of 9 years of cattle grazing on lodgepole pine nutrition and growth. The study provides evidence that cattle grazing is compatible with forestry. These results support the integrated use of forested rangelands in southern British Columbia. Attempting to extrapolate these findings to other site conditions should be done with caution."	1	2	477-485	cattle farming; grazing; growth; pines; plant height; plant nutrition; trees; woody plants	Canada	British Columbia	50.61	-120.85	Cattle		Silvopasture		Forest without grazing		Total productivity (pasture + trees)		Positive								Kremer2011_1168	Journal Article	2011	"Kremer, Robert J.; Kussman, Robert D."

However, cultivation of annual crops decreases soil organic matter and increases soil erosion potential, especially on sloping landscapes. Perennial crops maintain a continuous soil cover, increase water infiltration, reduce soil erosion, and improve overall soil quality. The objective of this on-farm study was to assess the effects of a perennial legume, kura clover (Trifolium ambiguum M. Bieb.), on soil quality in a recently established pecan (Carya illinoinensis Wangenh. C. Koch) orchard. The pecankura clover agroforestry practice was established on deep loess soils of the Missouri River hills landscape. These silt loams are on 2-20% slopes and can be highly erosive. Kura clover, introduced as the alley crop 5 years after pecan planting, was selected based on its perennial growth habit, nitrogen-fixing ability, winter hardiness, high forage quality, and soil conservation properties. Kura clover was seeded in 2001 and harvested for hay annually beginning 2003. Soil quality indicators of total organic C, total N, water-stable aggregates, and selected soil enzymes were determined on surface soil samples collected annually after kura clover establishment. Soil organic C and activities of soil enzymes increased compared with cultivated and grass pasture control soils by the eighth year of establishment. Water-stable aggregation improved by 50% and surface soil shear strength improved significantly (P < 0.05) in alleys compared with control sites. Results illustrate that kura clover as the alley-cropped component improved soil fertility and biological activity through increased organic matter and improved soil structure, and yielded high quality forage valuable for the cattle-feeding operation. Kura clover maintained or improved soil quality, reduced soil erosion potential, and benefited pecan growth by providing a source of soil nitrogen and improving soil structure for adequate water infiltration and aeration."	83	2	209-pp		USA	Missouri	39.53	-92.98	Pasture without livestock		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees					Soil organic carbon		Positive					Koukoura2007_1180	Journal Article	2007	"Koukoura, Z.; Kyriazopoulos, A."

Areas below canopies received 67% of the ambient rainfall and 27-48% of the ambient photosynthetically active radiation and had 2.3-5.2 C lower soil temperatures compared to areas outside the canopies. Although soil moisture, nutrient and organic matter levels seemed more favorable for plant growth under the canopies, aboveground biomass was lower below canopies compared to open areas at the two savannas, while biomass was equal between canopy and open areas on the one pasture that was measured. This indicates that other factors, such as light, were more important in determining plant biomass. For all sites, plant composition under tree canopies differed from that outside the canopies. Savanna plant species were predominantly perennial and native while pasture species were mostly perennial and exotic. Grazing, fire and previous introductions of prairie species may have been major factors in determining the prevalent species (>5% cover) for a given site. Poa spp. were more prevalent below canopies compared to open areas on all sites, despite their different disturbance histories."	130	1	277-297		USA	Wisconsin	43.06	-89.44	Cattle		Wood pasture		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Negative	Soil organic matter		Positive					Knowles1992_1198	Journal Article	1992	"Knowles, R.

Some care is taken to avoid browsing and debarking. About 135 stems/ha are pruned to height 6 m. A recently developed model (PC-STANDPAK) was used to evaluate current and projected yields, cash flow and profitability of 3 agroforestry options in comparison with conventional farming with no trees: (1) 135 stems/ha on 83 ha; (2) 225 stems/ha on 83 ha; and (3) 225 stems/ha on 70 ha. The results indicated that for farming to provide equivalent returns from the same land, gross margins would have to increase from NZ$29 to 60/livestock unit (LSU), or livestock carrying capacity would have to increase from 8 to 16 LSU/ha. Economic returns from option 1 were similar to returns from option 2, but option 2 is likely to produce logs of a superior quality and is, therefore, recommended.

Water movement through the upper 150 cm of the soil was measured using a neutron probe (1) under the tree canopy, and (2) in the unshaded grass vegetation between canopies; measurements were also made of soil dry bulk density and texture. Dry bulk density and moisture release curves were significantly different in the 2 locations, with the water content always greater under the trees than in the open. Estimates of field capacity and the measured driest profiles provided the upper limit of soil water storage; trees always improved the storage capacity, which was 215-266 mm under trees and 137-172 mm in the open. By connecting graphically the points of equal water contents in a depth-time plane (represented here as isopleths, given in 2 colour plates, one for Castilblanco and the other for Cazalla), a powerful tool is obtained which provides comparisons of water flow in the contrasting locations. The different water contents are shown to lead to an important delay in surface moisture depletion under the trees. Most root systems of the herbaceous vegetation are located in this surface horizon. 'Rainfall efficiency' for fall recharge, defined as the rainfall/storage ratio, was greatest under the trees.

Wildlife-related activities as well as annual and periodic cash flows from timber and livestock sales were included in the analysis. Land expectation value (LEV), equivalent annual income (EAI), and rate of return (ROR) were compared for a silvopastoral system and four traditional southern monocultural systems. The profitability of silvopastoral systems is comparable to other land use systems. Silvopasture further provides opportunities for incorporating wildlife-related activities through hunting leases and possesses both quality and quantity of wildlife habitat not available in other systems. On average, the inclusion of hunting leases increases LEVs from 3.1 to 30.6% per acre over a range of lease and interest rates.

Grazing for vegetation manipulation requires the same information needed to apply any chemical or mechanical method: knowledge of the effective timing, frequency, and intensity of application, and the selectivity of impact. The first study, a two-year series of grazing trials, examined the degree of cattle preference for deerbrush as compared to conifers, and response of deerbrush to grazing on a forest site. The second, a three-year study based on grazing trial results, used clipping to examine the specifics of deerbrush response to patterns of herbivory. Deerbrush was highly preferred by cattle in the grazing trials. Even at 90% utilization of the shrubs, no conifers were browsed. High degrees of utilization did not suppress shrub growth in the grazing trials. The clipping study found deerbrush significantly responsive to frequency and intensity of defoliation (P < 0.01), but not to season of use (P > 0.1). High intensity, frequent grazing is required to suppress the shrub. Intermediate prescriptions can be used to manage for various combinations of wildlife, timber, or forage-related objectives.

Best management practices for adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change include modifications to farm production through adjusted intensity and product types and changing land use through crop siting and tillage practices. Farmer perceptions of risk and profitability of best management practices are key determinants of adoption, which traditional incentive programs like the Environmental Quality Incentive Program attempt to address by providing financial and technical support. To ensure that payments offered through these programs that maximize adoption, regional incentive payments must be based upon locally established costs. This paper focuses on the cost of implementing and maintaining climate change specific best management practices (CCBMPs) for twelve diverse farms in Vermont. Specifically, three CCBMPs for Vermont are examined: cover cropping, management intensive rotational grazing (MIRG), and riparian buffer strips. Results show the average cost for cover cropping is $129.24/acre, MIRG is $79.82/acre, and a tree based riparian buffer strip cost $807.33/acre. We conclude that existing incentive payments for cover cropping and MIRG are below costs, likely resulting in under-adoption."	5	3	68-pp		USA	Vermont	44.14	-72.6	Mixture of sheep and cattle		Riparian strip		Baseline from implementation		Multiple	"Total productivity, livestock growth"	Positive								PositiveHedrick1969_1380	Journal Article	1969	"Hedrick, D.

Increases in soil and herbage nutrient levels close to the shelterbelt suggest that nutrient transfer by animals to the sheltered zones may have occurred. Shelterbelt tree growth was assessed and projected forward to maturity. Merchantable log volume at age 28 years was predicted to be 2300 msuperscript 3/km of shelterbelt. Based on current log prices the 7-row shelterbelt was estimated at age 28 years to have a net value of $130 000/km."	55		4-76	agroforestry systems; biomass production; forage; merchantable volume; nutrients; pastures; pines; plant composition; production; shelterbelts; silvopastoral systems; soil chemistry; trees; wood; woody plants; yield forecasting	New Zealand		-38.72	176.09	Mixture of sheep and cattle		Shelterbelt/Windbreak		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Mixed results (positive and negative)								Hawke1993_1393	Journal Article	1993	"Hawke, M.

Six trials were conducted, each for 30 d duration between spring 1986 and autumn 1988, at tree age 13-15 years and with livestock age 7-15 months. Mean liveweight gain over all trials for 0 (open pasture), 50, 100 and 200 stems per hectare was 170, 155, 136 and 94 g/sheep/day, respectively. Liveweight gain increased curvilinearly with increasing pasture allowance at all tree stockings and tended to level off above 3 kg green dry matter/head daily. Green matter pasture in vitro digestibility of the 'green' pasture fraction changed little with increasing tree stocking despite changes in pasture composition. Pine needle accumulation under the higher tree stockings depressed the quality of the total feed on offer. Details are given of differences in data between seasons.

To date, their economic benefits have not been assessed, partly because of the difficulty in evaluating the many interrelated pasture, soil, animal and forestry factors. Recent shelterbelt research in New Zealand has been conducted as a collaborative approach by AgResearch, Forest Research and Hort Research. Results of pasture, soil and tree measurements in the East Coast region indicate that shelterbelts, however managed, do not significantly increase pasture production in the sheltered zone. The competitive effects of trees reduce soil moisture in zones close to the shelter, which also encourages the accumulation of dung and urine nutrients in this zone by animals seeking protection. The modification in resting patterns as a result of shelter may be reflected in improved animal welfare and production but this was not measured. The value of timber from shelterbelts on the East Coast indicates that they have a role in diversifying farming income and offering a modified land use, which will help to sustain productive farming practices."	61		143-152	agroforestry systems; animal welfare; economic evaluation; farming systems; grassland management; grasslands; income; land use; livestock farming; nutrients; pastures; shelter; shelterbelts; silvopastoral systems; soil fertility; soil water content	New Zealand		-39.76	176.7	Mixture of sheep and cattle		Shelterbelt/Windbreak		Baseline from implementation		Total productivity (pasture + trees)		Mixed results (positive and negative)								PositiveHawke1991_1400	Journal Article	1991	"Hawke, M.

P. radiata is grown across a wide range of sites in New Zealand and under several management regimes. For agroforestry, P. radiata is usually grown under a direct sawlog regime with final tree stockings of around 200 stems/ha. Lower tree stockings allow pasture production well into the rotation (tree age 15) to the extent that at 100 stems/ha, pasture growth is 32% that of open pasture (no trees). Pasture growth declines with increasing tree stocking and age. Pasture botanical composition changes from high producing temperature pasture species to low fertility grasses and legumes. Under closely spaced pines, high levels of accumulated decaying needles smother the remaining pasture. Sheep performance generally declines with time in a totally planted agroforestry site. Feed quality (in vitro digestibility) of pasture decreases with increasing tree stocking. Factors affecting livestock performance in temperate agroforestry include class and species of stock, livestock shelter, pasture management, gastrointestinal parasite populations and ingestion of decaying pine needles. The significance of these factors and the benefits of agroforestry to the New Zealand scene are discussed.

At a European scale, the UK is one of the countries with the lowest woodland cover, currently extending to only 13% of the total land area of the UK, this is less than half of the European Union (EU) average of 37 per cent. A significant study carried out by Read et al. (2009) identified that UK wide there is a need to increase significantly levels of new planting and forest creation by more than 23,000 ha each year over the next 40 years if a substantial influence on reversing climate change is to be realised. It is clear that expansion of the total forested area in the UK necessitates the establishment of new woodland and forest cover on farmland which is either owner occupied or rented out. The main barriers to woodland establishment on farmland cited in the literature, include cultural resistance notably a dichotomous view of farming and forestry as being competing land uses; and lack of awareness of the potential economic benefits of woodland. This study intended to provide information that will improve farmers and landowners understanding of the potential economic differences between business as usual (sheep farming) and woodland creation in the uplands of the UK. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bio-economic potentials of temperate upland clear fell forestry systems in the UK over the last 60 years and determine if afforestation of upland farms has historically produced, and will in the future produce better financial outcomes than conventional upland sheep farming. The study used a bio-economic model based on discounted cash flow analysis to compare and evaluate a conventional upland sheep grazing system against a temperate upland forestry system. Historic investments to cease upland sheep grazing and afforest upland farms in the UK based on historic financial budgeting information available to farmers and landowners in 1956, 1976 would not have been an economically viable and profitable land use change compared to continuation of upland sheep grazing in the UK. Historic markets in 1956 and 1976 were not strong enough to render potential forestry investments profitable without a need for grant assistance. Investments to cease upland sheep grazing and afforest upland farms in the UK in 1996 would have been economically viable and profitable land use investment as timber markets alone were strong enough to render potential forestry investment profitable without a need for grant assistance. Without subsidy, investments to switch from upland sheep grazing and afforest upland farms in 2016 would not be an economically viable and profitable land use change. Current day timber markets alone are not strong enough to influence new woodland establishment."	71		32-pp		UK		53.25	-1.26	Sheep		Farm woodland		Pasture without trees		Multiple	"Total productivity, livestock growth"	Mixed results (positive and negative)								PositiveHale2018_1438	Journal Article	2018	"Hale, Robin; Reich, Paul; Daniel, Tom; Lake, Philip S.; Cavagnaro, Timothy R."

Despite strong links between edaphic conditions and riparian zone function, limited research has tested how soil properties respond to restoration, especially in an experimental context. With this important knowledge gap in mind, we established a field experiment to asssess structural vegetation and soil responses in the eight years following livestock exclusion and replanting in lowland streams in south-eastern Australia. On three streams, paired restored and control sites were experimentally established and we monitored vegetation (stem density, cover of bare ground and tree canopy, and loadings of organic matter), once beforehand, and then biennually after restoration. Selected soil properties (total carbon, total nitrogen, plant-available phosphorus) were sampled once shortly after restoration, then after another five years. Significant changes in structural vegetation occurred (e.g. decreased bare ground, increased plant stem density, organic matter, and canopy cover). In contrast, those soil properties did not respond. A mega-drought occurred throughout much of the study which was immediately followed by severe flooding. The floods redistributed organic matter at our study sites, with this effect mediated by vegetation structure: the probability of organic matter retention was positively correlated with groundcover and stem density of plants. The timing of flooding was also correlated with increased soil carbon and nitrogen, which could be due to increased productivity in these systems (for the former), or potentially due to increased fertiliser inputs or increased fixation (for the latter). Our study is the first to comprehensively and experimentally test how vegetation, litter layer and surface soil properties respond following riparian restoration, and will help guide the development and implementation of other monitoring programmes."	252		71-pp		Australia		-36.21	143.84	Sheep		Riparian strip		Baseline from implementation					Soil organic carbon		No effect		Positive			Hackl2000_1443	Journal Article	2000	"Hackl, E.; Zechmeister-Boltenstern, S.; Kandeler, E."

N-pool sizes and N fluxes were measured relative to N losses via leaching and denitrification in summer. On each mountain, four types of pasture were studied: (1) forest pastures, (2) recently developed pastures formed by forest clearance ('new pastures'), (3) older established pastures, and (4) pastures planted with clover. At both study sites (Scheuchegg and Teufelstein) we obtained similar results. Compared with forest pasture soils, open pasture soils were found to have greater microbial biomass and faster mineralization potentials, but net field mineralization rates were slower. In the forest pastures, highest N losses via denitrification were found. Higher potential leaching of NO3-, estimated by accumulation of NO3- on ion-exchange resins, in the forest pasture soils suggests lower N uptake by microbes and herbaceous plants compared with open pastures. N2O-production rates of the forest pasture soils at the Scheuchegg site (11.54 micro g N2O-N m-2 h-1) were of similar magnitude to those reported for spruce forests without pastures, but at Teufelstein (53.75 micro g N2O-N m-2 h-1) they were higher. However, if forest pastures are not overgrazed, no elevated N loss through N2O production and leaching of NO3- is expected. Denitrification rates in the open pastures (0.83-7.50 micro g N2O-N m-2 h-1) were low compared with reports on lowland pastures. In soils of the new pastures, rates of microbial N processes were similar to those in the established pastures, indicating a high capacity of soils to restore their internal N cycle after forest clearance."	32	4	280-284	alpine grasslands; Alps; cycling; deforestation; denitrification; grassland soils; grasslands; leaching; microorganisms; mineralization; mountain areas; mountain soils; nitrogen; pastures; soil	Austria		47.26	15.04	Cattle		Wood pasture		Pasture without trees									Negative			Guevara-Escobar2007_1450	Journal Article	2007	"Guevara-Escobar, Aurelio; Kemp, Peter D.; Mackay, Alec D.; Hodgson, John"	Pasture production and composition under poplar in a hill environment in New Zealand	Agroforestry Systems	0167-4366	10.1007/s10457-007-9038-9	<Go to ISI>://WOS:000244683900004	"Traditionally, poplar (Populus spp.) have been planted to control erosion on New Zealand's hill-slopes because of their capacity to dry out and bind together the soil. Two systems: (1) widely spaced, planted poplar for soil conservation, and (2) non-eroded open pasture were compared to determine the relative effect of the poplar-pasture system on the production, nutritive value and species composition of the pasture, and on the water balance. Measurements were made at three sites with mature poplar (> 29 years and 37-40 stems ha(-1)) and at a replicated experiment with young poplar (5 years, 50-100 stems ha(-1)). Soil water relations did not suggest strong competition for water between poplar and pasture. Pasture accumulation under mature poplar was 40% less than in the open pasture, but under young poplar was similar to that in the open pasture. Chemical composition of pasture suggested that feed quality of pasture in the open was better than under the poplar canopy, except during spring, when most chemical components were similar. At the most, in vitro digestibility of pasture dry matter was 8.9% lower and metabolisable energy of pasture dry matter was 1.5 MJ kg lower under the poplar canopy than in the open pasture. Shade tolerant species were not dominant in the plant community under the poplar canopy with grasses such as browntop (Agrostis capillaris, L.) and ryegrass (Lolium perenne, L.) being a high proportion of the plant community. Differences in chemical composition were related to differences in the botanical composition between the open pasture and the poplar understorey. It was concluded that the greatest effect of poplar was on pasture production due to shading, and that management of this silvopastoral system needs to focus on control of the tree canopy to lessen the decrease in pasture production."	69	3	145-148		New Zealand		-40.09	175.89	Mixture of sheep and cattle		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Negative								Guevara-Escobar2002_1452	Journal Article	2002	"Guevara-Escobar, A.; Kemp, P.

Soil hydraulic characteristics, macroporosity, water aggregate stability, and bulk density were also similar in the PP and OP areas. The differences in the earthworm numbers and mass between the PP and OP areas were inconsistent. Pasture grown in the PP topsoil produced more over 11 months than treatments containing OP topsoil. In addition to increasing the stability and, hence, sustainability of hill soils at risk from erosion, poplar trees enhanced several other key attributes of the soil.

To achieve the same levels of accuracy in estimating the mean for SOC, substantially more samples were required in the highly variable woodland surface soils, whereas sub-surface numbers were more comparable between woodland versus pasture. Woodland soil BD was generally more variable than pasture, this being reflected in the need for larger sample numbers. The SOC variability was in part related to arbitrary demarcation between the soil component and other input sources of C such as the litter and CWD layers.

Increases in woody plant cover alter the distribution of carbon in the ecosystem and can affect water and nutrient cycling. Although semiarid rangelands comprise almost half of the global land surface, our understanding on the effects of woody plant encroachment on carbon stocks in these ecosystems is uncertain - studies have found both net C gains and losses. We measured, for the first time in South American semiarid savannas, ecosystem C stocks along a gradient of woody plant density across 30,000 km(2) of the Caldenal in central Argentina. We characterized changes in C stocks in live biomass (woody and herbaceous, above- and belowground), litter, and soil organic carbon (to 1.5 m depth) pools along a woody plant cover gradient (0-94%). We found a significant increase in ecosystem C stocks with increasing woody cover, with mean values of 4.5, 8.4, 12.4, and 16.5 kg C m(-2) for grasslands, shrublands, open and closed forests, respectively. Using dendrochronological data we estimated the average C accrual rate to be 104 g C m(-2) yr(-1) at the ecosystem (plant + soil) level. Woody plant cover and soil silt content were the two primary factors accounting for the variability of ecosystem C. We developed simple regression models that reliably predict soil, tree and ecosystem C stocks from basic field measurements of woody plant cover and soil silt content. These models could prove to be valuable tools for broad scale estimation if linked to regional soil maps and remotely sensed data, allowing for precise and spatially explicit estimation of C stocks and change at regional scales.

We compared eleven grazed woodlots under various livestock management regimes with five woodlots that have not been grazed for at least 30 years in the Kickapoo Watershed in Crawford County, WI. We conducted vegetation surveys in all the woodlands and measured soil properties in a subset. We talked to farmers about their cattle management practices and beliefs about farm woodlots. Grazed woodlands had higher frequencies of introduced shrubs, less litter depth, fewer seedlings and saplings, more grass cover, and higher soil bulk density compared with un-grazed woodlands. Grazing negatively impacted regeneration and condition of seedlings, saplings, and saplings of commercial value. In grazed woods, we noted a relation between the cattle stocking rate and edaphic variables including amount of bare soil, litter depth, and canopy cover, and a difference between dairy and beef cattle in shrub density. We validated a set of simple indicators and metrics for on-going comparison of grazed and un-grazed farm woodlots in this area. Introduced shrub species was the clearest indicator of change, followed by litter depth, regeneration status of trees, and soil bulk density. The study points to potential opportunities for silvopasture techniques that could mitigate vegetation and soil degradation such as careful management of livestock stocking rate and timing of grazing."	260		80-92		USA	Wisconsin	43.22	-90.69	Cattle		Farm woodland		Forest without grazing		Total productivity (pasture + trees)		Positive								GÃ³mez-Rey2011_1583	Journal Article	2011	"GÃ³mez-Rey, Maria XesÃºs; GarcÃªs, Ana; Madeira, Manuel"	Organic C distribution and N mineralization in soil of oak woodlands with improved pastures	Revista de CiÃªncias AgrÃ¡rias	0871-018X		<Go to ISI>://SCIELO:S0871-018X2011000100008	"Cork oak woodlands in Portugal are a multipurpose agroforestry system occurring in areas mostly degraded by former cereal crops and overgrazing.

Soil samples were collected in a square grid around scattered cork oak trees to evaluate the spatial variability of soil bulk density and chemical properties. In soil samples taken beneath tree canopy and in the open, net N mineralization was evaluated by aerobic incubations. Also, laboratory incubations were carried out to evaluate the effect of roots (tree or/and herbaceous) and water solutions (bulk precipitation, throughfall or stemflow) on net N mineralization.Contents of organic C, total N and extractable P were increased beneath the tree canopy, and gradually decreased with the increase of distance to the tree trunk. Improved pastures established 26 years ago increased organic C (0.76 kg m-2), total N (0.06 kg m-2) and extractable P (2.70 g m-2) amounts in the 0-10 cm soil layer beneath the tree canopy relatively to those of unmanaged pastures. Net N mineralization was significantly greater (about 2 times) in soils beneath the tree canopy than in those of open areas. N mineralization was unaffected by addition of throughfall or stemflow, while a significant reduction resulted from tree roots addition, this effect being stronger for herbaceous plant roots than for tree roots. Maintenance of tree cover combined with permanent improved pastures should be considered to improve soil quality in oak woodlands of Southern Portugal. em Ã¡reas frequentemente degradadas pelo cultivo de cereais e de sobre pastoreio.

In general, these woodlands are not managed specifically for timber or cattle benefits. This lack of management often leads to decreased timber value and reduced forage yields. Silvopasture is a potential alternative to overcome this lack of land management on Minnesota woodlots. However, very limited information are available about silvopasture use in Minnesota. This three-year study evaluated the potential for silvopasture in Minnesota by comparing the production of unmanaged woodland grazing, silvopastoral, and open pasture systems. Three farmers from Central Minnesota collaborated in this study to assess these grazing systems. Silvopasture paddocks were established when thinning and seeding were performed on woodland areas. We assessed forage production, forage quality, and livestock performance. Forage production was generally greater in silvopastoral systems compared with unmanaged woodland grazing systems, while forage quality was lower in open pasture systems, at least during the first year. Livestock performance was similar between the grazing systems. Results indicate that silvopasture has potential in Minnesota, but more research is required to develop specific management guidelines as well as to monitor silvopasture production systems for longer periods of time."	93	1	57-66		USA	Minnesota	46.05	-94.9	Cattle		Silvopasture		Forest without grazing		Multiple	"Total productivity, livestock growth"	Mixed results (positive and negative)								PositiveFonseca2016_1613	Journal Article	2016	"Fonseca, Ana Margarida P.; Marques, Carlos A.

Livestock also profit from the acorns, and the grazing contributes to avoid shrub encroachment. In the last 20 years, subsidies from the European Union have greatly promoted cattle rearing in this system and the introduction of heavy breeds, at the expense of sheep, goats or the native cattle breeds. The balance of the traditional system is thus threatened, and a precise assessment of the balance between the different components of the system, therefore is highly needed. The goal of this study was to gain a better understanding of a Montado farm system with cattle rearing as the major economic activity by applying the emergy evaluation method to calculate indices of yield, investment, environmental loading and sustainability. By integrating different ecosystem components, the emergy evaluation method allows a comprehensive evaluation of this complex and multifunctional system at the scale of an individual farm. This method provides a set of indices that can help us understand the system and design management strategies that maximize emergy flow in the farm. In this paper, we apply the emergy evaluation method to a Montado farm with cattle rearing, as a way to gain a better understanding of this system at the farm scale. The value for the transformity of veal (2.66E+06 sej J(-1)) is slightly higher, when compared to other systems producing protein. That means that the investment of nature and man in this product was higher and it requires a premium price on the market. The renewability for Holm Oaks Farm (49 %), lower than for other similar systems, supports the assumption that this is a farm in which, comparing with others, the number of purchased inputs in relation to renewable inputs provided by nature, is higher. The Emergy Investment Ratio is 0.91 for cattle rearing compared to a value of 0.49 for cork and 0.43 for firewood harvesting, making it clear that cattle rearing is a more labor demanding activity comparing with extractive activities as cork and firewood harvesting."	90	1	215-6		Portugal	Montemor-o-Novo	38.64	-8.2	Cattle		Dehesa/Montado		No comparator		Livestock growth		Positive								Ffolliott1989_1628	Journal Article	1989	"Ffolliott, P.

Information is needed on the yield response of forage grown as an understory crop among trees. The light environment of a conifer silvopasture was characterized by three methods, a hand-held photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) meter for quick measurements over a large area, fixed PAR meters recorded using data loggers for a large number of measurements over time, and hemispherical photography with software to calculate seasonal direct beam radiation. Light data were considered in terms of forage yield. Plots were harvested when forage reached 20-25 cm in height after which the entire area was grazed by sheep. There were limitations to all methods of quantifying radiation environment for predicting yield. Yield decreased linearly with decreased PAR; however, data variability was high and correlations, while statistically significant, were weak. Grazed silvopastures are dynamic with shifting yield patterns in response to the interactions between the spatially variable soil, changing seasonal environment, and spatially variable animal impacts for each grazing event."	65	3	179-188		USA	Virginia	37.79	-81.17	Sheep		Silvopasture		No comparator		Understory/pasture production		Negative								Feldhake2009_1661	Journal Article	2009	"Feldhake, C.

While some grazing in woodlots is common, a set of guidelines for optimal utilization of these areas is not. We thinned a white oak dominated mature second growth forested area establishing two 0.5 ha, eight-paddock, orchardgrass-perennial ryegrass-white clover silvopasture replications for comparison with two nearby open pasture replications. After thinning trees, silvopastures were limed, fertilized and seeded. Sheep were fed hay and corn scattered across the area to facilitate removal of residual understory and incorporation of applied materials into surface soil. We measured soil moisture in the top 15 cm using TDR and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) using a system of 16, 1 m line Quantum Sensors during the subsequent growing seasons of 2004, 2005, and 2006. Paddocks were rotationally grazed by sheep with two 1 m2 herbage mass samples taken prior to animal grazing. There was no significant difference in soil moisture between silvopastures and open pastures however, there was adequate rainfall to prevent drought all three years. The two silvopasture replications had residual tree stands of 14.1 and 15.6 m2 ha-1 diameter breast height allowing 42 and 51% of total daily incident PAR compared to measurements in the open field. Total forage mass yield from open pasture for 2004, 2005 and 2006 was 9.9, 10.5 and 10.2 t ha-1 respectively and for silvopasture 8.5, 6.7 and 6.7 t ha-1. Silvopastures received 47% of open pasture incident PAR yet yielded an average of 72% as much herbage mass as the open pastures.

During these periods, air temperature is frequently adequate for forage growth to supply feed for grazing animals. The effect of thermal radiation from conifer tree canopies on forage canopy temperature was evaluated for a silvopasture with variable tree density. A long-wave radiation-sensitive sensor for measuring temperature at the forage canopy level was designed, tested, and used to approximate night time forage canopy temperature during the autumn of 1999 and 2000 and spring of 2000. Temperature from the designed sensor correlated linearly with forage canopy temperature measured with an infrared thermometer with a slope of 1.0, a 0.9 degreesC offset, and an r(2) of 0.999. The response of sensor temperature to night sky shading by trees was also linear. Under 77% tree cover sensor temperature remained within half a degree of air temperature, however, under 7% cover averaged 10.4 degreesC below air temperature during radiation frost events. The results of this study indicate that a well designed silvopasture can potentially extend the grazing season period on both ends in regions were radiation frosts are prevalent.

Silvopastures offer solutions to many management issues associated with grazing systems in Appalachia (USA). Several tree species have been proposed for silvopastures in humid temperate regions, but few data comparing animal performance from systems with different deciduous tree species are available. The objective of this project was to compare early-stage honeylocust (Gleditsia triacanthos)or black walnut (Juglans nigra)silvopastures with open pastures in terms of forage botanical composition, yield, and nutritive value, and in terms of gain, carcass characteristics, and meat quality of hair sheep (Ovis aries) that grazed these systems. Forage and animal performance from open systems (i.e., no trees) was compared with that from silvopastures containing 13- and 14-year-old honeylocust or black walnut trees. Cool-season grass-legume pastures were rotationally stocked with crossbred hair sheep from mid-June through September in 2008 and 2009. Forage production varied by year and pre-graze forage mass in black walnut silvopastures generally was less (P0.05) than in open pastures at most measurement periods. Averaged over the season, forage production in honeylocust silvopastures tended (P=0.0937) to be lower than in open systems in 2008 and was lower (P=0.0001) in 2009. Few differences in forage nutritive value among systems were observed. Total and average daily gains (ADG) did not differ among treatments in 2008, but black walnut silvopastures supported less (P0.05) ADG and total gain than open pastures and honeylocust silvopastures in 2009. Carcass characteristics evaluated did not vary among treatments although hot carcass weights were lower (P<0.05) for lambs that grazed black walnut silvopastures. Although walnut-based systems were less productive and will need modification to improve output, similar levels of performance between open pastures and honeylocust systems show the potential of silvopasture systems to supply multiple products from the land base without reducing agricultural system production."	93	1	199-219		USA	Virginia	37.22	-80.42	Sheep		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees		Livestock growth		Mixed results (positive and negative)								Erskine2002_1705	Journal Article	2002	"Erskine, W.

Cultivated basins produce an average sediment yield of 7.1 t/ha/year whereas grazed pasture and forest/woodland basins export averages of only 3.3 and 3.1 t/ha/year, respectively. Nevertheless, these yields are high by Australian standards. Sediment exports from grazed pasture and forest/woodland basins are similar because the forest/woodland basins are also grazed. Dam sediments are enriched in clay and organic matter in comparison to topsoils. Gullies and bank erosion are not active geomorphic processes in the drainage basins investigated so that the measured sediment yields could be validly compared to soil loss rates determined by empirical soil loss equations, Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE), Soiloss and Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), which do not account for gully and channel erosion. These equations accurately predicted the measured sediment yields, with MUSLE being the most accurate. Although Soiloss is the only empirical equation to use Australian data, MUSLE performed marginally better, despite being a simplified version of the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) that is used for teaching.

We analysed historical, ecological and land use data to understand the threats to native vegetation, and prospects for future recovery in the wheat-sheep zone of the Wimmera and Mallee in southeastern Australia. We analysed air photos, surveyed 60 remnant vegetation sites, and interviewed land managers about a subset of 35 remnants. Our analysis confirmed that soil types favoured for cropping were largely cleared before 1945; mean cover declined from 8% to 5% between 1945 and 2000. Small patches (<5 ha) account for a quarter of remaining woody cover. Cover of crops increased at the expense of pasture. Small patches were typically frequently grazed, nutrient enriched and were dominated by an exotic annual understorey. Recruitment of woody species was uncommon, and non-existent in the small patches. Landholders valued small patches primarily for stock shelter but without recruitment their long-term persistence is doubtful, even though most farmers are grazing less now compared with 30 years ago. Meeting regional native vegetation cover targets likely depends on retention of all existing vegetation patches, plus considerable revegetation. However, although current land use trends allow the sparing of some marginal lands while cropping intensifies, this option cannot satisfy vegetation cover targets and may not preserve biodiversity. More significant gains in native vegetation cover may not occur unless new opportunities arise for the current cohort of farmers. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

This study was undertaken to measure the size of C stocks in three predominant ecosystems: Pinus ponderosa-based silvopastoral systems (SPS), pine plantations (PPP) and natural pasture (PST), and examine how clover affect tree growth and stocks of soil C. The C contents of trees and pasture were determined by destructive sampling and dry combustion. Soil samples were taken at 0-5, 5-20, 20-40 cm depths in order to determine soil C and N. For PPP and SPS total aboveground tree C was 38.4 and 53.1 kg tree(-1) and belowground was 21.3 and 23.4 kg tree(-1), respectively. Annual diameter increment at breast height was 1 and 2 cm in PPP and SPS, respectively, and was significantly higher in SPS. Trees in SPS, due to lower density and the presence of leguminous pasture, demonstrated enhanced growth and C sequestration. Soil organic C (SOC) stocks at 0-40 cm depth were 193.76, 177.10 and 149.25 Mg ha(-1) in SPS, PST and PPP, respectively. The conversion of PPP to SPS and PST to PPP resulted in an increase of 44.51 Mg ha(-1) and a decrease of 27.85 Mg ha(-1) in SOC, respectively. Favorable microclimatic conditions in relation to air temperature and soil moisture were observed in SPS as well as a synergy between trees and pasture."	86	2	296-pp		Chile	Patagonia	-46.89	-72.76	Cattle		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees					Multiple	SOC AND total carbon	Positive					Doyle1986_1772	Journal Article	1986	"Doyle, C.

Using the model, an assessment has been made of the implications of varying the density and the planting pattern of the trees on the combined income from the sale of wood and livestock over a number of years. The resultant incomes have been compared with that from an equivalent unafforested area to assess the likely economic implications of intercropping trees with grass. At a discount rate of 5%, the indications are that combining wood and sheep meat production on the same area could be financially attractive. At higher discount rates, the economic attraction of growing trees is more dependent on an increase in timber prices relative to those prevailing at present. However, given the large number of assumptions necessitated by the limited availability of data and in the absence of any means of validating the model, extreme care is needed in interpreting the results. Confident economic projections of the value of intercropping trees with grass await further experimental work on appropriate growth models for open-grown trees, light interception, tree rooting patterns and water uptake of tree roots."	21	1	65-68	Agroforestry; broadleaves; economics; Farm forestry; grasslands; intercropping; models; Silvopastoral systems; simulation; simulation models; trees; woody plants	UK		51.46	-0.97	Sheep		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees		Multiple	"Total productivity, livestock growth"	Mixed results (positive and negative)								Mixed results (positive and negative)Douglas2001_1778.1	Journal Article	2001	"Douglas, G.

In New Zealand, they are a nation-wide problem, particularly on pastoral hill country grazed by livestock. On these landscapes, trees are planted at low densities, often <70 stems per hectare (sph), to reduce landslide occurrence, but there has been limited quantification of their effectiveness in this role. This study determined the reduction in landslide occurrence at 65 sites planted with spaced trees (53xPopulus, 6xSalix, 6xEucalyptus) following rainstorm events. Sites had a mean slope angle of 27 degrees and soils were predominantly silt or sand-loams. Tree density across all sites was 3265sph, height was 843m, canopy radius was 110m and trunk diameter was 1899cm. Trees reduced landslide occurrence by 95 per cent compared to paired pasture control sites (0 center dot 4 per cent vs. 7 center dot 9 per cent scar area, respectively), and scars occurred on fewer sites with trees than pasture (10 vs. 45). For the 10 tree sites with scars, their area was <3 center dot 5 per cent, except at one site where it was 11 center dot 3 per cent. There were no significant differences between species in their effectiveness in reducing landslide occurrence. Analyses were partially successful in discriminating between sites with and without shallow landslides and identified some attributes with potentially useful discriminatory power. Aspect, mean slope angle and tree density did not feature significantly in the analyses because they were homogeneous across site groups. The study verified the large benefit from wide-spaced tree planting on sites susceptible to shallow landslides.

Ruminant livestock production generates more greenhouse gas emissions than other types of agricultural production and most livestock mitigation options to date have a modest greenhouse gas reduction potential (<20%). Trees and soils, by comparison, can sequester large amounts of carbon depending on the availability of land. Previous studies on carbon neutral livestock production have shown that farms with a stocking rate of 8 dry sheep equivalents (DSE)/ha can be carbon neutral or carbon positive by sequestering more carbon than is emitted from the farm. However, the carbon offsets required by farms with higher stocking rates (>20 DSE/ha) has yet to be studied in Australia. The challenge is to sequester enough carbon to offset the higher level of emissions that these higher stocked farms produce. This study calculated the carbon balance of wool, prime lamb and beef enterprises using a range of stocking rates (6-22 DSE/ha) and levels of tree cover in two agroecological zones. Emissions from livestock, energy and transport were offset by the carbon sequestered in trees and soils. Additionally, the carbon balance was calculated of a case study, Jigsaw Farms, an intensive sheep and beef farm in south-eastern Australia. The methods used to calculate emissions and carbon stocks were from the Australian National Greenhouse Gas Inventory. The majority of stocking rates were carbon positive over a 25-year period when 20% of the sheep or beef enterprises were covered with trees. This study demonstrated that substantial reductions can be made in greenhouse gas emissions through the use of carbon sequestration, particularly in trees. The results showed that from 2000 to 2014 Jigsaw Farms reduced its emissions by 48% by sequestering carbon in trees and soil. The analysis of different stocking rates and tree cover provides an important reference point for farmers, researchers and policy analysts to estimate the carbon balance of wool, prime lamb and beef enterprises based on stocking rate and the area of tree cover."	58	9	61-72		Australia	Victoria	-37.6	141.84	Sheep		Farm woodland		Baseline from implementation					Livestock offset/mitigation		Positive					Doran-Browne2016_1786	Journal Article	2016	"Doran-Browne, Natalie A.; Ive, John; Graham, Phillip; Eckard, Richard J."

Therefore, it is desirable to reduce or offset those emissions where possible. Although mitigation options exist that reduce ruminant GHGE through the use of feed management, flock structure or breeding management, these options only reduce the existing emissions by up to 30% whereas planting trees and subsequent carbon sequestration in trees and soil has the potential for livestock emissions to be offset in their entirety. Trees can introduce additional co-benefits that may increase production such as reduced salinity and therefore increased pasture production, shelter for animals or reduced erosion. Trees will also use more water and compete with pastures for water and light. Therefore, careful planning is required to locate trees where the co-benefits can be maximised instead of any negative trade-offs. This study analysed the carbon balance of a wool case study farm, Talaheni, in south-eastern Australia to determine if the farm was carbon neutral. The Australian National Greenhouse Gas Inventory was used to calculate GHGE and carbon stocks, with national emissions factors used where available, and otherwise figures from the IPCC methodology being used. Sources of GHGE were from livestock, energy and fuel, and carbon stocks were present in the trees and soil. The results showed that from when the farm was purchased in 1980-2012 the farm had sequestered 11 times more carbon dioxide equivalents (CO(2)e) in trees and soil than was produced by livestock and energy. Between 1980 and 2012 a total of 31100 t CO(2)e were sequestered with 19300 and 11800 t CO(2)e in trees and soil, respectively, whereas farm emissions totalled 2800 t CO(2)e. There was a sufficient increase in soil carbon stocks alone to offset all GHGE at the study site. This study demonstrated that there are substantial gains to be made in soil carbon stocks where initial soils are eroded and degraded and there is the opportunity to increase soil carbon either through planting trees or introducing perennial pastures to store more carbon under pastures. Further research would be beneficial on the carbon-neutral potential of farms in more fertile, high-rainfall areas. These areas typically have higher stocking rates than the present study and would require higher levels of carbon stocks for the farm to be carbon neutral."	56	02-Mar	84-9		Australia		-34.98	149.14	Mixture of sheep and cattle		Farm woodland		Baseline from implementation					Livestock offset/mitigation		Positive					Dominati2014_1792	Journal Article	2014	"Dominati, E.

The influence of space-planted trees, a soil conservation practice, on the provision of services, was also assessed. The economic value of the services provided by an uneroded steep pasture grazed by sheep and cattle was estimated at NZD 3717 ha(-1) yr(-1). This value dropped by 65% when the topsoil was lost in a single shallow mass movement. Fifty years after erosion, the services only recovered to 61% of uneroded value. In contrast, the same landscape type planted with soil conservation trees provided, after 20 years, additional (+22% in dollar value) services from the similar unprotected landscape. A benefit cost analysis of soil conservation practices showed planting conservation frees is only profitable if the frees are harvested for Limber (age 20), and low discount rates (< 5%) are used. When the economic value of the extra services from conservation trees is included in the BCA, the Net Present Value of the investment is greatly positive at discount rates ranging from 0% to 10%. Analysis of this ecological infrastructure investment using an ecosystem service approach offers new insights for resource managers and policy makers., (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The group included representation from landowners, government agencies and scientists. The group was facilitated through an action research approach incorporating three phases: (1) awareness; (2) forecasting; and (3) implementation. The group identified a set of goals and indicators relevant to achieving a ""well managed rural hill catchment"" The indicators were used to (a) assess the current state of the catchment farm in relation to the goals; (b) evaluate a range of strategies for improving system performance and (c) evaluate progress toward the goals following land use changes implemented within the catchment farm. Key issues for the group included the availability of data and the setting of appropriate performance benchmarks. From both economic and environmental points of view, the existing farm system was failing to meet the goals set by the management group. Key factors driving these outcomes included the physical and productivity limitations of the soil resource, poor livestock performance and poor water quality. A mixture of research observations, decision support models and expert stakeholder knowledge indicated scope for improving performance through forestry, riparian management, erosion control and livestock intensification options. Based on their evaluation of the forecasting results, the group developed a new land use plan, which depended on significant capital investment in land use and enterprise change. Subsequent monitoring of soils, vegetation, water quality, animal production and financial results over four years showed marked improvement in a number of key performance indicators. In particular, sediment and phosphorus loads and faecal coliform levels decreased rapidly, native forest fragments showed early signs of restoration, lamb and beef productivity increased and the per hectare financial returns of the pastoral component increased. Better matching of land use to land capability has led to short-term improvement in some aspects of the economic and environmental performance of the catchment farm. Progress toward a more sustainable agricultural system was achieved, but at a substantial cost for transformation of the biophysical system, which has implications for the wider sector.

This has been attributed to a combination of factors including improved water use efficiency by shaded grass and increased water availability through hydraulic lift by trees. The objectives of this research were to determine if silvopastures changed forage mass production and available soil water, and to determine how these two factors were related. Forage mass and soil water were sampled at 1.0, 2.0, and 3.6 m from the tree stem, or plot center under honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos L.), black walnut (Juglans nigra L.) and shade cloth in 2006 and 2007. Soil water was measured in the top 10 cm of soil using a capacitance probe, and at 30-cm intervals, from 45 to 105 cm, using a neutron probe. Forage was collected to determine dry mass and annual yield. In 2006, forage mass was greater under black walnuts and honey locusts than under 70% shade cloth. In 2007, with a 50% shade cloth, forage growth was similar in all treatments. In both 2006 and 2007, soil moisture in the top 10 cm was higher under shade cloth compared to honey locust or black walnut trees. Similarities in forage mass between treatments in 2007 indicate that the differences in soil water were not biologically significant for forage growth. Lower forage mass under the 70% shade cloth in 2006 was due to suppressed growth from intense shading. The major implication for pasture managers is that trees in these pastures had no negative effect on soil water availability and forage growth."	83	2	689-703		USA	Virginia 	37.19	-80.4	Pasture without livestock		Silvopasture		Baseline from implementation		Understory/pasture production		No effect				No effect				Dahlgren1997_1877	Journal Article	1997	"Dahlgren, R.

This study examines the effects of oak trees and low to moderate intensity grazing on soil properties and nutrient pools in a blue oak (Quercus douglasii H.&A.) woodland in the Sierra Nevada foothills of northern California. Four combinations of vegetation and management were investigated: oak with grazing, oak without grazing, open grasslands with grazing, and open grasslands without grazing. Results indicate that oak trees create islands of enhanced fertility through organic matter incorporation and nutrient cycling. Compared to adjacent grasslands, soils beneath the oak canopy have a lower bulk density, higher pH, and greater concentrations of organic carbon, nitrogen, total and available P, and exchangeable Ca, Mg, and K, especially in the upper soil horizons (0-35 cm). In contrast, the light grazing utilized at this site had minimal effects on soil properties which included an increase in the bulk density of the surface horizon and an increase in available P throughout the entire soil profile. While low to moderate intensity grazing has little effect at this study site, there could be much larger impacts under the more intensive grazing practices utilized on many rangelands. The lack of oak regeneration and oak tree removal to enhance forage production may eventually lead to large losses of nutrients and soil fertility from these ecosystems. Results of this study have important implications for predicting how management practices may potentially affect oak regeneration, water quality, and ecosystem sustainability."	39	1	155-169		USA	California 	39.25	-121.31	Cattle		Forest grazing		Forest without grazing	Pasture without trees				Soil organic carbon		Positive	Negative			Negative	Currie1978_1888	Journal Article	1978	"Currie, P.

Silvopastoral production systems depend on forest species development and tree density established, but also on soil fertilization management practices, which may modify the tree-pasture relationship. Pinus radiata is broadly used in the Atlantic biogeographic region of Spain and it is a fast-growing species with a very dense canopy that could limit pasture production if planted at a high density. One of the main factors limiting pasture productivity on forestlands, especially at early plantation stages, is the low soil fertility, making it necessary to add products to overcome the acidity of the soils and the low nutrient availability. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between tree cover and pasture production in a Pinus radiata stand developed on a very acid soil. The results obtained showed a negative linear relationship between litterfall biomass and pasture production and positive relationship between litterfall biomass and tree height."	17		363-374		Spain		42.26	-8.34	Pasture without livestock		Silvopasture		Other	Different tree densities	Understory/pasture production		Decrease with increased tree density/cover/proximity								Cossens2000_1931.1	Journal Article	2000	"Cossens, G.

Current recommendations to farmers are to plant tree on the less productive areas of the farm and adopt a tree stocking rate which fully utilises the site."	62		203-208	agroforestry; farm forestry; livestock farming; pines; silvopastoral systems; trees; woody plants	New Zealand	Akatore	-46.13	170.11	Mixture of sheep and cattle		Wood pasture		Baseline from implementation		Total productivity (pasture + trees)		Mixed results (positive and negative)								PositiveCoelho2012_1956	Journal Article	2012	"Coelho, Marta Baptista; Paulo, Joana Amaral; Nunes Palma, Joao Henrique; Tome, Margarida"	Contribution of cork oak plantations installed after 1990 in Portugal to the Kyoto commitments and to the landowners economy	Forest Policy and Economics	1389-9341	10.1016/j.forpol.2011.10.005	<Go to ISI>://WOS:000302986600009; https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/272157/1-s2.0-S1389934112X00030/1-s2.0-S1389934111001845/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEAIaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIQC8qc3LNGmDeDT83miYg1tRVNrx%2F2B3FlR%2FkgpgkUIY0QIgMcSQj2A%2F4ivItqyZXN4JFyuUlYM%2BU1kLkgETljpegi0qvQMIuv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARACGgwwNTkwMDM1NDY4NjUiDPFxRCgr9lZttKK4MiqRA3rvdJ0iteFh%2BjksRqlnNnR9Kz2MwSNiRd%2B5PRAWq9qJCvm%2FywWUDqUNhx%2F9hU1SQOiC9GPYqrAlxDInHoz29UwYqK3nGGrM9itrtJiTmwmJATWMjbeUSiOqbHtWEqxIkFLmev6%2FUGCHgbTFbk80fkippB0FfhJLVym4ot4ke4tQ52BrsGGiHroOiJxhDqUCYZidDUWhe%2BihO8usXefDckkXKm4YC3PIZfFRY5eOHEMjSH7902hqmKpmK0xhki7IyM18yS957mUHjy05U2YwL3pEHFFntm0EtOY2dipYOoy0LH35mzq1LxgMbyaPx1ArRjiXGWSiSGqKoeJjDKi5He2R2syLN1G%2FelHQnm0OF6IlpLmxiECqD3ll%2Bcx74jVdSGulLr7VJ%2BBs6aJtoALIpwz7H8tC1W19YP3BHvq1F%2FfQYjHwSlCxUBbrh2toEt1ngmrAp0Ef9FV9WVgEzTZovISChTMNM1b237K5l%2BeR6eZc7CJ2XTXlMsvFaxaJMwb0NQMCrQwg9Cdwsd0CFhPfeMNDMMa1qfIFOusBf85ZL%2FDTY0ol3ZrAAPyTvjuvaeBBK2H4%2FkqVBidn1vyciIWj0RbMXnZn1VFlITHXYhOCBF9N2b0Jk1xL%2BsBwq5kaMf0oDjfoY0HTl%2BhmuEGAQf%2FBaYeaZ7ul%2BBR4zndMl%2BN1sWW2HyGcmI4%2BdRZSpdPSpcCEyfb3Zo092bfaegIqF5hBp4JBfJllVYyBFGF7c%2FiJ9bfxBfpSfOMaY34gJI4rP3f9Ba34F%2FUWKpwLv50CxHuhfZJzVxawsRhcAPisDGk69TruTaRB%2BCTwAwWCtzk4ofwZgXoc8Aq1eP36OhB0%2BvPzgNGErwFNCg%3D%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20200217T100427Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTY44ZQJADJ%2F20200217%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=7103cd2d2f13a4a1c2baf6ebd93c2aca48ef184353d24c684b5b93af0497608a&hash=250af36226729072d20aead5adcf338ce46b163e9f184596b596f1b0c30d1b9c&host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&pii=S1389934111001845&tid=spdf-cb597918-8177-4b17-8c90-2667580ca613&sid=6600d5da1884e6475a2a85b800c96bdc5469gxrqb&type=client	"Cork oak stands are a part of the agroforestry ecosystem in Portugal, characterized by a low crown cover from cork oak trees, managed towards cork production, and sometimes in combination with grazing. In recent years, European Union policies gave impetus to a large area of new cork oak plantations, which have been established mainly for cork production purposes, and consequently with higher stand density than traditional agroforestry systems. These plantations are important not only for cork production but also for the carbon sequestered by these slow growing forests that won't be harvested for wood production. Thinning operations will be needed to avoid excessive inter-tree competition and wood extracted from these thinning may also provide income for the owners. In the present study, carbon sequestered and wood volumes resulting from thinning were estimated for the next 70 years. Three scenarios of different annual afforestation rates and different site indexes were tested. The resulting values for the considered scenarios show that, if the plantation rates are maintained, new cork oak plantations will have an important contribution to the Portuguese commitments to providing CO2 offsets under the Kyoto protocol. Additionally, due to the increasing values of initial density in new cork plantations, cork oak forests will produce a significant volume of wood that may become an important contribution to the landowners' income.

Despite this, our understanding of the effects of different tree species and forest land use on soil hydraulic properties is limited. In this study we tested for the effects of two tree species, sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), subject to contrasting land use systems, namely ungrazed forest and livestock grazed forest, on soil surface saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-fs) at a long term (23 year) experimental site in Scotland. Additionally these forest land use systems were compared to grazed pasture. K-fs was found to be significantly higher under ungrazed Scots pine forest (1239 mm hr(-1)) than under ungrazed sycamore forest (379 mm hr(-1)) and under both of these forest types than under pasture (32 mm hr(-1)). However, this measure did not differ significantly between the sycamore and Scots pine grazed forest and pasture. It was inferred, from comparison of measured K-fs values with estimated maximum rainfall intensities for various return periods at the site, that surface runoff, as infiltration excess overland flow, would be generated in pasture and grazed forest by storms with a return period of at least 1 in 2 years, but that surface runoff is extremely rare in the ungrazed forests, regardless of tree species. We concluded that, although tree species with differing characteristics can create large differences in soil hydraulic properties, the influence of land use can mask the influence of trees. The choice of tree species may therefore be less important than forest land use for mitigating the effects of surface runoff."	310		239-245		UK	Scotland	56.89	-2.54	Sheep		Forest grazing		Forest without grazing								Mixed results (positive and no effect)				Cerda1998_2015	Journal Article	1998	"Cerda, A.; Schnabel, S.; Ceballos, A.; Gomez-Amelia, D."

Measurements were made in various conditions with simulated rainfall to gain an idea of the annual variation in runoff and soil loss. important seasonal differences were noted due to surface cover and moisture content of soil,but erosion rates were determined primarily by runoff. Surfaces covered with grass and shrubs always showed less erosion; surfaces covered with holm oaks showed higher runoff rates, due to the hydrophobic character of the soils.

It is well established that reforestation can have a profound impact on soil physicochemical properties but the associated changes to soil microbial communities are poorly understood. Therefore, the objective of this study was to quantify changes in soil physicochemical properties and microbial communities in soils collected from reforested pastures and compare then to remnant vegetation and un-reforested pastures. To address this aim, we collected soil from two locations (pasture and its adjacent reforested zone, or pasture and its adjacent remnant vegetation) on each of ten separate farms that covered the range of planting ages (0-30 years and remnant vegetation) in a temperate region of southeastern Australia. Soils were analysed for a range of physicochemical properties (including C and nutrients), and microbial biomass and community composition (PLFA profiles). Soil C:N ratios increased with age of tree planting, and soil C concentration was highest in the remnant woodlands. Reforestation had no clear impact on soil microbial biomass or fungal:bacterial ratios (based on PLFA's). Reforestation was associated with significant changes in the molecular composition of the soil microbial community at many farms but similar changes were found within a pasture. These results indicate that reforestation of pastures can result in changes in soil properties within a few decades, but that soil microbial community composition can vary as much spatially within pastures as it does after reforestation.

A preliminary study was undertaken in the Nant Pontbren catchment, mid-Wales. Experimental tree shelterbelts were established in selected pastures of land used for sheep grazing. Water infiltration rates were up to 60 times higher in areas planted with young trees than in adjacent grazed pastures. This demonstrates that farm trees could represent a key landscape feature, reducing run-off even when only present as a small proportion of the land cover.

Our experimental scheme was developed to determine to which extent it is important to integrate perennial grasses and, for our environmental conditions, what are the species yielding better results under rotational and extensive systems of pasture exploitation. Near Elvas, Portugal, trials were established to compare biodiverse sown pastures (CMIX) with natural ones (NS). The results show that, in terms of biomass yield, it is possible to detect, on the first year of the trial, a small positive response corresponding to CMIX. On the second year, the results show an important increase of CMIX in relation to NS. A finer analysis of the benefits of the sowing state reveals that on the second year there were very important increases in legume and grass proportion in the biomass. The grasses introduced that had more persistence are Dactylis glomerata followed by Lolium perene and Phalaris aquatica. The other perennial grass introduced in the mixture, Festuca arundinacea, had great difficulties to persist."		79	2-pp	adaptation; biomass production; extensive farming; farming systems; fodder legumes; fodder plants; grassland improvement; grassland management; grasslands; legumes; pastures; rotations; sown grasslands	Portugal	Elvas	38.88	-7.17	Cattle		Silvopasture		Other	Biodiverse sown pastures vs. natural ones	Understory/pasture production		Positive								Carlson1994_2038	Journal Article	1994	"Carlson, D.

Treatments included all possible combinations of two tree-planting patterns (trees planted 2.4 m apart in a grid, and groups of five trees spaced 7.6 m between clusters) and two grazing/understory management systems (agroforests were seeded to subclover and grazed by sheep; forests were unseeded and ungrazed). Mean twig xylem water potential (XWP) for Douglas-fir trees ranged from -0.3 to -1.5 MPa on forest plots and from -0.3 to -1.2 MPa on agroforest sites. Pre-dawn and sunset XWP were more negative for forest than for agroforest plots during dry summer periods. Midday XWP was similar for both agroforest and forest plots on all dates. Soil water content at 50-100 cm depth was greater under agroforest plots as compared to forest plots in 1984, but not in 1985 (unusually dry spring). Average foliage nitrogen content of tree needles was 1.54% vs. 1.43% for agroforests vs. forests, respectively. Our data are consistent with the hypotheses that: (1) grazing of understory vegetation may reduce water stress of trees during dry periods by reducing transpirational water use by the forage plants; and (2) nitrogen-fixing vegetation combined with grazing increases nitrogen uptake of associated trees. However, neither mean foliar N nor average XWP differences experienced by trees in agroforest versus forest plantations were sufficient to have an effect on tree growth. Our data demonstrate that it is possible to produce a second crop (i.e. forage grazed by sheep) in timber plantations without reducing the growth of the main tree crop.

Cedar Run and Slab Cabin Run, the treatment streams, and Spring Creek, an adjacent reference stream without riparian grazing, were monitored prior to (1991-1992) and 3-5 years after (2001-2003) riparian buffer installation to assess channel morphology, stream substrate composition, suspended sediments, and macroinvertebrate communities. Few changes were found in channel widths and depths, but channel-structuring flow events were rare in the drought period after restoration. Stream bank vegetation increased from 50% or less to 100% in nearly all formerly grazed riparian buffers. The proportion of fine sediments in stream substrates decreased in Cedar Run but not in Slab Cabin Run. After riparian treatments, suspended sediments during base flow and storm flow decreased 47-87% in both streams. Macroinvertebrate diversity did not improve after restoration in either treated stream.

In silvoarable systems, trees are intercropped with arable crops, and in silvopastoral systems trees are combined with pasture for livestock. These systems may produce forage and timber as well as providing ecosystem services such as climate change mitigation. Carbon (C) is stored in the aboveground and belowground biomass of the trees, and the transfer of organic matter from the trees to the soil can increase soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks. Few studies have assessed the impact of agroforestry systems on carbon storage in soils in temperate climates, as most have been undertaken in tropical regions. This study assessed five silvoarable systems and one silvopastoral system in France. All sites had an agroforestry system with an adjacent, purely agricultural control plot. The land use management in the inter-rows in the agroforestry systems and in the control plots were identical. The age of the study sites ranged from 6 to 41 years after tree planting. Depending on the type of soil, the sampling depth ranged from 20 to 100 cm and SOC stocks were assessed using equivalent soil masses. The aboveground biomass of the trees was also measured at all sites. In the silvoarable systems, the mean organic carbon stock accumulation rate in the soil was 0.24 (0.09-0.46) Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) at a depth of 30 cm and 0.65 (0.004-1.85) Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) in the tree biomass. Increased SOC stocks were also found in deeper soil layers at two silvoarable sites. Young plantations stored additional SOC but mainly in the soil under the rows of trees, possibly as a result of the herbaceous vegetation growing in the rows. At the silvopastoral site, the SOC stock was significantly greater at a depth of 30-50 cm than in the control. Overall, this study showed the potential of agroforestry systems to store C in both soil and biomass in temperate regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Our objective was to determine forage yield and botanical composition in response to tree species, tree density, and slope position in an emulated silvopasture (the site had no animals). In 1995, black walnut (Juglans nigra L.) and honey locust (Gleditisia triacanthos L.) trees were planted within plots (r = 3) of predominantly tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) pasture. Trees were planted down slopes in rows to create low, medium, and high tree densities at shoulder-, mid-, and toe-slope positions. Sampling sites (n = 54) under field treatment combinations were harvested May to October at 35-d intervals in 2002 and 2003. Before spring, summer, and fall harvests, plots were subsampled for botanical composition. Tree species did not affect botanical composition when compared over the two seasons. Plots under honey locust trees tended to have more fescue in a dry year (2002) and more legumes and less dead herbage in a wet year (2003). Greater percentages of warm-season grasses and fewer weeds were observed at low tree density sites in 2003. Forage mass (5280,6130, and 4970 kg ha(-1) at low, medium, and high tree densities) was 16% greater under medium-density trees. Plots under black walnut yielded 13% more forage than those under honey locust (5790 vs. 5130 kg ha(-1)). Appropriately spaced trees have potential to positively alter botanical composition and can support greater forage production in a southern Appalachian silvopasture."	97	4	173-198		USA	Virginia	37.23	-80.42	Pasture without livestock		Silvopasture		Other	Different densities of planted trees	Understory/pasture production		Mixed results (positive and negative)								Bruck2019_2121	Journal Article	2019	"Bruck, Sonia R.; Bishaw, Badege; Cushing, Tamara L.; Cubbage, Frederick W."

We examined silvopasture, forest, and pasture systems in eastern North Carolina and northeastern Oregon. In North Carolina, we evaluated forest and agroforestry systems using loblolly and longleaf pine species. In Oregon, we evaluated forest and agroforestry systems using ponderosa pine. We based the analyses on typical forest and cattle regimes, including yields, costs, and prices obtained from the literature, and consulted with experts in the respective subjects. The financial viability of land management investments was investigated using capital budgeting techniques. Cash flows were developed using 4 percent and 6 percent real discount rates. Analysis suggests loblolly pine timber management and cattle management are more profitable than silvopasture management in eastern North Carolina. Additionally, cattle management is more profitable than silvopasture in northeastern Oregon.

GHG emissions per kilogram meat in the economic optimum differ between the production systems and range from 18 to 21.9 kg CO2-eq./kg meat. Only GHG offset by agroforestry systems showed the potential to significantly reduce these emissions. Depending on the production system agroforestry systems could reduce net GHG emissions by 66% to 7.3 kg CO2-eq./kg meat in the most intensive system and by 100% in the most extensive system. In this calculation a carbon sequestration rate of 8 t CO2/ha/year was assumed.

In addition, two fertilization levels (0 and 110 N+150 P2O5 kg/ha) and grazing intensity levels (0 and 0.8 sheep/ha/yr) were applied in a split-split plot experimental design. It was found that herbage yield was highest in the ungrazed and fertilized low tree density stands in all seasons. In the medium tree density stand, although light was lacking, fertilized plots produced higher herbage yield as compared to unfertilized low tree density stands while fertilization is of no use in close stands if herbage production is the goal. Animals seemed to prefer fertilized and medium density stands.

Producers require dependable plant resources and management practices that improve the seasonal distribution and persistence of high quality herbage, sustainability and environmental integrity of the agricultural landscape. It was hypothesized that inorganic N and fecal coliform concentrations delivered in leachate to the soil/bedrock interface would be lowest in deciduous forest (HF) and highest in pasture (CP) with HF converted to silvopasture (SP) between the two. Piezometers were used to monitor water quality at the soil/bedrock interface under conventional pasture, SP, and hardwood forest. The pasture and SP were rotationally grazed by sheep during the spring to fall grazing season (2004-2008). Geometric mean fecal coliform bacteria concentrations (FC) were greatest in SP (18 FC 100 mL(-1)) with no difference between CP (7.5 FC 100 mL(-1)) and HF (5.6 FC 100 mL(-1)). Mean NO(3)-N concentration was lowest in SP (2.3 mg L(-1)) and greatest in CP (4.4 mg L(-1)) and HF (4.1 mg L(-1)), which were not significantly different. Mean NH(4)-N concentrations showed different trends with the lowest mean concentration in CP (0.5 mg L(-1)) and the greatest in SP (2.5 mg L(-1)) and HF (2.6 mg L(-1)), which were not significantly different. SP was shown to be a management option in the study area that reduces nitrate leaching, but should be considered cautiously in near-stream areas and near wells where fecal bacteria pollution can be problematic. This study makes an important contribution to our knowledge about interactions between landscape management and environmental quality of the Appalachian region. A diversity of land and forage management options are needed to maximize forage and livestock productivity while protecting surface and groundwater quality of the region."	79	1	1817-1825		USA	West Virginia	37.67	-82.29	Sheep		Silvopasture	AND forest grazing 	Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production	forage quality and nutritional requirements 	Positive					Positive			Bird1995_2192	Journal Article	1995	"Bird, P.

The Willandra windbreak was 2 rows of direct-sown black wattle (Acacia mearnsii) aligned south-east-north-west. The Helm View windbreak was 4 rows of mixed Eucalyptus, Casuarina and Acacia spp., aligned east-west. Pastures at both sites had been sown to perennial ryegrass and subterranean clover. Wind direction data indicated that the north-eastern and south-western paddocks at Willandra were sheltered 39 and 28% of the time, respectively. The northern and southern paddocks at Helm View were sheltered 34 and 42% of the time, respectively. The relationship of rainfall with wind speed and direction was examined to indicate the potential of windbreaks of various orientations to protect livestock. The windbreaks had clear effects on pasture production in the competition zone along the margins of the windbreak. Average pasture production at Willandra in the zone 0.5-0.75 H (where H is the windbreak height) was 69% of open yield; production in the 0.9-1.5 H zone was 96%. At Helm View, production in the zone 0.7-1.0 H was 74% of open yield, with 81% in the zone 1.1-1.5 H. Averaged over all years, both windbreaks had no effect on pasture growth in the 2-10 H sheltered zone, although in some years there were small significant growth increases at parts of that zone in certain paddocks. Periodic soil moisture measurements at Willandra showed that water use was greater in the competition zone near the windbreak, with a difference in summer water content of the 1.2 m profile of at least 20 mm between soil 4.6 m from the windbreak and further away. The difference was due to greater water use from the deepest part of the profile.

Nevertheless, in the last decades, the stability of forest ecosystems has been jeopardized due to the abandonment of traditional agro-pastoral practices, so that the gradual reduction of open areas due to progressive succession processes has caused a high increase of grazing pressure by livestock and wild ungulates feeding on forest areas. This paper aims at showing a methodological approach for evaluating the effect of applying measures in order to improve the grazing value of grasslands and ecotonal patches and lower the grazing impact on native woodlands. A protected area in Sicily (Italy) is considered as a representative case study. The analysis of remotely sensed imagery and several field surveys enabled to identify and map six different land use units subject to grazing, i.e., (1) forests; (2) grasslands (pastures dominated by palatable herbs and grasses); (3) overgrazed grasslands (dominated by poisonous and/or thorny herbs and forbs, not palatable); (4) encroached pastures; (5) roadside firebreaks (dominated by palatable herbs) with no shrubs; and (6) wooded/encroached roadside firebreaks. Several data were collected through sample plots selected within each land use unit, in order to assess their pastoral value. These data have been used to define current and optimal animal stock rates aiming at addressing pasture management planning towards a sustainable use of forestland and shrubland."	7	6	45-52	agroforestry; agroforestry systems; case studies; firebreaks; forbs; forests; grasses; grasslands; grazing; pastures; shrubs; silvopastoral systems; stocking rate; sustainability; woodlands; woody plants	Italy 	Western Sicily 	38.01	13.25	Cattle		Forest grazing		Pasture without trees		Total productivity (pasture + trees)	Improve grazing value of grasslands and lower impact on woodlands 	Positive								Bezkorowajnyj1993_2204	Journal Article	1993	"Bezkorowajnyj, P.

A higher soil penetrometer resistance in the grazed areas pointed to a significant change in soil structure (i.e. dry bulk density) as a result of cattle traffic in the area. In a related experiment comparing the effect of three different levels of soil compaction on tree seedling growth and nitrogen cycling, it was found that water infiltration and nitrogen uptake were reduced in soils treated with a medium and high level of compactive effort. This resulted in a slower rate of growth of the tree seedlings. The addition of an additional nitrogen source improved seedling growth in both the medium and high density compactive treatments."	21	1	65-78		Canada	Ontario 	43.89	-80.31	Cattle		Silvopasture		Other	Soil compaction	Understory/pasture production	Seedling growth rate	Negative				Negative				Berhongaray2013_2210	Journal Article	2013	"Berhongaray, G.; Alvarez, R.; Paepe, J. de; Caride, C.; Cantet, R."

Eighty two farms, widespread over the region, were used for the study. At each farm paired treatments were sampled representing common land uses: trees, uncropped controls, seeded pastures, cropped fields and periodically flooded areas. Bulk density, SOC, SIC, texture, pH and electrical conductivity were determined to 1 m depth. Rainfall and temperature were obtained from climatic records. Significant differences were detected between treatments in SOC contents. Average SOC stocks to 1 m were: 131 t ha-1 under trees >101 t ha-1 in uncropped control >90 t ha-1 in pastures=86 t ha-1 in cropped field > and 70 t ha-1 in flooded sites. Compared with uncropped controls, SOC was significantly different in all soil layers under trees, to 75 cm depth in flooded sites and to 50 cm in pastures and cropped soils. Agriculture determined a reduction of 16% of SOC to 50 cm in sampled sites. In the 50-100 cm depth a decrease of 9% was observed, though not significant. The stratification pattern of SOC in depth was not affected by the treatments; implying that land use impacted the SOC sequestered in soil, but not its allocation in depth. SIC accounted for one third of total soil carbon, average SIC stock was 50 t C ha-1 to 1 m. Both, its stock and distribution in the profile were not affected by the treatments; with greater SIC stocks founded in deep soil layers. An artificial neural network model was developed that allowed the estimation of SOC (R2=0.64) based on climate, soil properties and land use. The model, linked to information from satellite image classification, was used for the estimation of present SOC stock of pampean soils, which accounted for 4.22+or-0.14 Gt in an area of 48.2 Mha. Using soil surveys performed during the 1960-1980 period we estimated a SOC stock of 3.96+or-0.22 Gt. Consequently, no change of total SOC stock seems to be produced in the last decades in the region. At smaller scale, counties with SOC content greater than 95 t ha-1 to 1 m depth lost carbon; increases prevailed below this threshold. Apparently, SIC reservoirs seem have not change during the last decades."	192		6-10	bulk density; carbon; carbon sequestration; classification; climate; conductivity; density; electrical conductivity; farms; land use; models; organic carbon; pastures; properties; rain; reservoirs; satellite imagery; soil; soil chemistry; soil organic matter; soil properties; soil surveys; stratification; surveys; temperature; treatment; trees; variation; woody plants	Argentina	Pampas	-37.08	-65.42	Unclear		Farm woodland		Pasture without trees					Soil organic carbon		Positive					Bergez1997_2212	Journal Article	1997	"Bergez, J.

Two densities (100 stems.ha(-1) and 400 stems.ha(-1)) were compared. The annual carrying capacity (live weight of the animals that a plot supports) was also recorded as an indirect figure of the overall agricultural production of the system. The silvopastoral plots received less radiation than the agricultural plot without trees, the 400 stems.ha(-1) treatment being more shaded than the 100 stems.ha(-1). Over the measurement period, on some special days, a maximum of 30% of the incoming radiation was intercepted on the 400 stem.ha(-1) treatment with the largest trees. The amount of light intercepted was highly correlated with the type of weather and the leaf area development of the trees: the brighter the day and more expanded the leaf area, the higher was the proportion of radiation intercepted by the tree. However, over the measuring period, a small amount of radiation was intercepted by the tree canopies. As a consequence, no differences were observed in the annual carrying capacity."	37	3	210-213		UK		53.6	-1.62	Sheep		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		No effect								Beckert2016_2233	Journal Article	2016	"Beckert, Marvin R.; Smith, Pete; Lilly, Allan; Chapman, Stephen J."

Woodland establishment in upland grasslands can be a carbon sink, but soil carbon losses have also been observed. Dedicated woodland plots and silvopasture are two contrasting strategies to achieve increased carbon stocks. We compared the carbon sequestration potential of the two approaches with three tree species (Hybrid Larch, Scots Pine and Sycamore) planted on permanent pasture on an upland farm in North East Scotland, 24 years after planting. Soil organic carbon was measured in the A (similar to 0-30 cm) and B (similar to 30-50) horizons. The soil carbon was also fractionated into labile, protected and resistant pools. Litter layers were measured and tree biomass carbon was estimated using allometric equations. We found that total soil carbon stocks (A plus B horizon) were similar and did not differ significantly between treatments, but for both coniferous species silvopasture tended to have the greater soil carbon stock followed by woodland, whereas Sycamore had the greater stock in the woodland treatment; pasture had the least carbon stock. Woodland stored more carbon in the labile fractions and litter layer than both pasture and silvopasture of all treatments, which had similar levels of stabilized carbon. Biomass per tree was significantly greater in the silvopasture treatments for all species, but on a per hectare basis woodland stored significantly more carbon. Land management comparison shows that large proportions of grassland would need to be converted to woodland to provide similar carbon benefits as the integrative silvopastoral system."	90	3	927-983		UK	Scotland	57.087445	-2.094315	Mixture of sheep and cattle		Silvopasture		Baseline from implementation					Soil organic carbon		Positive					Beardmore2019_2236	Journal Article	2019	"Beardmore, Leslie; Heagney, Elizabeth; Sullivan, Caroline A."

Trees can assist in catchment management, and re-afforestation strategies have been implemented in an effort to mitigate agricultural impacts and improve degraded land and waterways worldwide. Re-afforestation strategies often target private land, and their success relies on landholder participation. Landholders' decisions about land-use allocation are driven primarily by the private financial costs and benefits associated with different farming strategies. This research assesses the private on-farm financial impact and the public environmental benefit of land use transition from beef grazing to a mixed beef grazing-forestry system in the Richmond River catchment on the east coast of Australia. GIS analysis identified more than 30% of the catchment as beef grazing land potentially available for re-afforestation, across a variety of soil types and geomorphic characteristics. We used a farm-scale financial model to assess the costs and benefits associated with transition from grazing to a variety of cattle-forestry mixtures that were determined on the basis of their suitability to soil type and slope in different parts of a catchment. We also used a multi-criteria approach to assess the environmental outcomes associated with each transition. The results demonstrate that diversification to a mixed beef grazing-forestry system consistently provides environmental benefit, but the financial impact on landholders varies depending on soil type. Landholders on ferrosol and vertosol soils in this catchment have favourable options that can simultaneously deliver private and public benefits, whereas landholders on kurosol and dermosol soils are more restricted, with environmental improvements possible only as a trade-off with farm financial performance. Based on these results, we suggest that different policy mechanisms are required to encourage graziers in different parts of the catchment to shift towards mixed cattle-forestry systems."	87		25-pp		Australia	New South Wales	-28.87	153.59	Cattle		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees		Multiple	"Total productivity, livestock growth "	Positive								Mixed results (positive and negative)Bartolome1994_2247	Journal Article	1994	"Bartolome, J.

However, in the temperate regions of Australia their numbers are rapidly declining and they may be lost across much of the landscape in 200 years. Here we examined the spatial distribution of green (GDB), senescent (SDB) and total (TDB) dry pasture biomass, and nutrient status of the GDB fraction around scattered Eucalyptus trees on three parent materials (basalt, granite and meta-sediment) in native and sown pastures across a range of grazed temperate landscapes in northern New South Wales. We used a combination of destructive harvests and a handheld active optical canopy reflectance sensor (AOS) with an integrated GPS to examine pasture biomass around scattered trees. The harvested pasture biomass data indicated that under grazed conditions the presence of scattered trees did not introduce significant radial trends in TDB or GDB out to a distance of 3.5 canopy radii regardless of tree species or parent material. The red and near-infrared reflectance-based Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), as measured by the AOS, did indicate a consistent azimuthal trend with larger GDB on the southern side of the tree and lower GDB on the northern side in the native pasture. However, this observation must be qualified as the regression coefficient for the relationship between NDVI and GDB was significant but weak (best r(2) = 0.42), and SDB reduced its predictive capacity. We also found a higher percentage of GDB under the canopy than in the open paddock. We suggest that the combination of these results may indicate higher grazing pressure under trees than in the open paddock. Pasture nutrient concentration (P, K and S) was higher in both native and sown pastures beneath the tree canopy compared with the open paddock. This study indicates that, in this temperate environment, scattered trees do not adversely affect pasture production, and that they can improve some pasture nutrients."	33	2	7232-7244		Australia	New South Wales	-30.31	151.42	Mixture of sheep and cattle		Wood pasture		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production	Pasture quality higher under trees	No effect								Bangura2015_2261	Journal Article	2015	"Bangura, A.; Oo, Y.

The samples were collected in the spring (September 2011) and autumn (March 2012) at increasing distance from the midpoint of shelterbelts. To determine the SOC level in the sample, two permanganate oxidisable methods were used: the Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and labile carbon analysis method. Regression analysis of our result indicated no significant difference (P>0.005) in SOC along the sampling points in an increasing distance from the midpoint of the shelterbelts in both seasons. However, there was a significant difference (P<0.005) in SOC level between the two depths. During autumn at 0.00-0.10 m depth the TOC was higher at Weston 1 (1.386%) than College 4 and Leeds Parade site with 1.146% and 1.11% respectively.

We studied the impact of component land cover types (forested vs. adjacent herbland) in three agroforestry systems (hedgerow, shelterbelt and silvopasture) on organic C and nitrogen (N) distribution in three density fractions of soils at the 0-10 and 10-30 cm layers. The study evaluated 36 sites (12 hedgerows, 12 shelterbelts and 12 silvopastures) in central Alberta, Canada, distributed along a soil/climate gradient of increasing moisture availability. At the 0-10 cm layer, soil organic C (SOC) stock in the bulk soil was significantly greater in the silvopasture system (101) than in either the hedgerow (77) or shelterbelt system (67 Mg C ha(-1)). Soil organic C stock in both soil layers (0-10 and 10-30 cm) was also significantly greater in the forested land cover (89 and 119 Mg C ha(-1), respectively) than in adjacent herblands (76 and 77 Mg C ha(-1)). Across all sites, 31.5, 29.1, and 35.5% of SOC was found in the light fraction (<1.6 g cm(-3)), occluded fraction (ultrasonic dispersion at 360W for 5 min, <1.6 g cm(-3)), and heavy fraction (>1.6g cm(-3)) of soils, respectively. The largest pool of SOC in the more labile light fraction of the 0-10 cm layer was in the silvopasture system (50 Mg C ha(-1)), whereas the smallest labile light fraction component of SOC was in the shelterbelt system (17 Mg C ha(-1)). The largest pool of SOC in the more stable heavy fraction of both the 0-10 and 10-30 cm depth classes was in the shelterbelt (33 and 35 Mg C ha(-1), respectively), while the least SOC was in the silvopasture system (26 and 20 Mg C ha(-1), respectively). We conclude that the presence of Populus based silvopasture system can increase C storage in surface mineral soils, and that the establishment of Picea based shelterbelts in an otherwise annually cropped agricultural landscape enhances the size of the stable SOC pool.

In particular it describes the P release processes occurring in riparian buffer strips. Soil samples at three depths (0-2.5, 2.5-7.5, and 7.5-15 cm) were collected from riparian buffer strips, including wetland and non-riparian areas at three pasture sites. These soil samples were analysed for total P, plant available P as measured by Olsen P, and soil solution P as measured by 0.01M CaCl2-extractable P. The P retention capacity and P buffering capacity of the riparian soils were also measured. A significant relationship was found between Olsen P and 0.01M CaCl2-extractable soil P, indicating that soils with a high plant available P pool (measured as Olsen P) potentially have a high P loss in subsurface flow (as represented by CaCl2-extractable P). All of the CaCl2-P concentrations in the top 2.5 cm soil depth at the study sites were higher than the threshold concentration (0.01 mg CaCl2-P litre-1) considered to stimulate fresh water algal growth. This P could contribute to P losses through leaching and surface runoff. However, soils at lower depths (2.5-7.5 and 7.5-15 cm) were found to have higher P sorption and higher P buffering capacity, thus potentially can trap more (15-45 kg P ha-1) than the surface profile (0-2.5 cm). Subsoils may therefore play an important role in controlling P release. The P release may vary depending on the P sorption characteristic of soils and flow pathways. Development of riparian buffer strips for an effective decrease in P losses from intensively grazed systems should take into account P release characteristics of the soil, the distribution of P in soil profile, and the time necessary for plant available P (i.e., Olsen P) to decline to acceptable levels."	49	3	363-374	grassland soils; grazing; phosphorus; riparian vegetation; soil depth; soil types; subsoil; vegetated strips; vegetated waterways; wetland soils; wetlands	New Zealand		-40.900557	174.885971	Cattle		Riparian strip		Pasture without trees									No effect			Ash1998_2302	Journal Article	1998	"Ash, A.

Rainfall during the experimental period was above average, producing good conditions for pasture growth, which resulted in little influence of stocking rate on pasture or dietary attributes. During the growing season, forage quality, as measured by nitrogen concentration and in vitro digestibility, was higher in sown pasture than in native pasture, and higher in plots with live trees than in plots with killed trees. Treatment differences in herbage quality disappeared later in the year when pastures senesced. In sown pasture treatments, there was no effect of tree killing on legume (Stylosanthes spp.) quality. However, Stylosanthes made a greater contribution to the diet of cattle grazing in wooded paddocks than in paddocks where trees had been killed. The proportion of Stylosanthes in the diet reached a peak in May and then declined. Oversewing increased both diet quality and feed intake while, to a lesser extent, killing trees resulted in generally lower diet quality and feed intake. Estimates of liveweight change were made from the quantities of energy and protein consumed by the cattle. As expected, large increases in liveweight gain were predicted to occur in oversewn pastures compared with native pastures. However, estimates indicated that animal performance may be better where trees are left intact rather than killed. While carrying capacity is greatly increased with the removal of trees, this may be at the expense of individual animal performance. Possible reasons for this significant negative response in dietary attributes and predicted liveweight gain to tree killing are discussed."	131		153-6		Australia		-19.4	145.45	Cattle		Wood pasture		Pasture without trees		Livestock growth		Positive								Arturi2014_2307	Journal Article	2014	"Arturi, Marcelo; Perez, Carolina; Torres Robles, Silvia; Arnal, Mariana"	Tree canopy-herbaceous layer relation in temperate woodland: seasonal variations in forage quantity and quality	Range Management and Agroforestry	0971-2070		<Go to ISI>://WOS:000342882200016	"Tree cover affects herbaceous composition and productivity and can improve forage quality and quantity.

Species cover, grass and forbs biomass were estimated in five canopy types: (1) no tree cover, (2) full cover of deciduous trees, (3) partial cover of deciduous trees, (4) full cover of evergreen trees and (5) partial cover of evergreen trees. Differences between canopy types in green and total biomass depended on sampling date. In the moderately grazed range, the biomass of green grasses under the partial cover of deciduous trees was higher and lower than in no tree cover areas in winter and summer respectively. In the heavily grazed range, this biomass for both canopy types was similar in all the seasons. Similar C, grass cover was found in winter and spring in no tree cover and under the partial cover of deciduous trees. However, C-4 cover was greater in no tree cover which is likely to be related with the greater standing dead biomass compared with any canopy type. Moreover, temporal variation of green biomass suggests that phenology differs between grasses under different canopy type. Since green biomass was found to be enhanced by different canopy types in different seasons, herbivores might benefit by the combination of canopy types at a landscape scale."	35	1	36-44		Argentina		-35.11	-57.17	Cattle		Forest grazing		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Mixed results (positive and negative)								Anderson1987_2332	Journal Article	1987	"Anderson, G.

The trees were pruned annually from year 4 and those with poor form were progressively culled until final stand densities of 75, 150 and 225 trees ha-1 were achieved 7 years after planting. The pastures were grazed by sheep from year 4. The sheep carrying capacities of the pastures declined as tree density increased because of competition between trees and pasture and also because of debris from thinning and pruning. In year 7, under the high density trees, the sheep carrying capacity of the pastures was 73% and light transmission was 69% of that of control pastures (no trees) and debris covered about 22% of the pasture. Diameter growth measurements from year 5 to 7 were 7.65, 7, 45 and 6.35 cm for low, medium and high density of trees respectively, which indicates that competition between trees had commenced at the high density (P<0.05). There was little conflict between the agricultural and forestry components at the low stand density with satisfactory production from both. This system has the potential to generate annual income to offset pine establishment and silvicultural costs while providing another source of income in the long term. It is being tried on farm scale by some landholders wishing to diversify from grazing-only enterprises. Â© 1987, CSIRO.

Pasture, sheep and tree growth and changes in soil and foliar nutrient levels were measured over a four year period. Clover establishment was most satisfactory. In the second year the pastures under tree densities of 150 or more trees/ha carried 60% of the numbers of sheep carried on the pastures with no trees. Two years later, following increased canopy growth and shading, this relative carrying capacity was down to 40%. After four years, soil and foliar nutrient levels were not affected by tree density. At the lowest density of trees (< 100 stems/ha), individual tree diameter growth and volume production per hectare were stimulated and there was least loss of agricultural productivity. This density was therefore preferable for agroforestry.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of modifying tree covers by uncontrolled logging and grazing processes on soil quality, in a mature and unmanaged roble (Nothofagus obliqua (Mirb.) Blume) forest. Soil quality was evaluated under partly-closed (PC), partly-open (PO), and open (OP) forest covers, and two soil depths. The indicators used were soil organic C (SOC), potential net N mineralization (N-min), and nitrification (N-NO3), soil microbial respiration (SMR), microbial biomass C (MBC), soil aggregates, and light fraction (LF). At 0-5 cm soil depth SMR and MBC in PC cover was approximately 12% higher than in PO and OP covers. For the same soil depth N-min in PC cover was 68% and 95% higher than in PO and OP covers, respectively; and for N-NO3 PC cover was 45% higher than PO cover. OP tree cover presented a negative N-NO3 (immobilization). Dry weight for LF fraction in OP cover (labile OM) was 90% and 67% lower respect PC and PO covers, respectively (P < 0.05). The soil quality and the activity of its microbial processes were affected by alteration of tree cover, as well by the anthropic action of logging and extensive grazing, the soil in OP cover was the most affected."	78	1	118-26		Chile		-37.04	-71.39	Cattle		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees					Soil organic carbon		Positive					Alexander1976_2357	Journal Article	1976	"Alexander, G.; Lynch, J.

The forage within each cage was clipped to 2 in. twice during the growing season, dried to a moisture-free basis and weighed.

Effect of grazing on carbon sequestration and tree growth that is developed in a silvopastoral system under wild cherry (Prunus avium L.)	Catena				"Silvopastoral systems have been considered a good tool for carbon sequestration by taking up atmospheric carbon dioxide and storing it in the soil. The effect of animal presence on carbon sequestration in this type of agroforestry system has been studied recently. However, the soil carbon storage in these systems is influenced by the stocking rate. In addition, soil fractions have been known to influence carbon storage. This study was undertaken in order to examine the effects of livestock grazing at two different stocking rates [Light Stocking Rate (LS; 4 sheep ha_ 1) and Heavy Stocking Rate (HS; 8 sheep ha_ 1)]. This was compared with the soil chemical and physical properties of No Grazing (NG) pastures, the amount of C stored in the whole soil, in three different soil fractions (250Ð2000, 53Ð250, and b 53 _m), at each of four soil depths (0Ð25, 25Ð50, 50Ð75, and 75Ð100 cm), and the tree growth in a silvopastoral system under Prunus avium L. The presence of animals in silvopastoral systems plays an important role in carbon sequestration by the direct or indirect modifications of the pH, the soil bulk density, and the soil fraction proportions. The LS treatment promoted carbon sequestration linked to macroaggregates in the upper soil layers when compared with the HS treatment and the NG treatment. However, in deep horizons, the NG treatment enhanced the soil organic carbon storage more than did the grazing treat- ments and this carbon was linked to microaggregates, increasing the soil density. A better carbon concentration was found when 1 m of soil depth was evaluated in an LS treatment, but no differences were apparent in the carbon storage per hectare that were found due to a high soil bulk density in an NG treatment"	142		11-20		Spain	Galicia	42.985833	-8.194722	Sheep		Silvopasture		Forest without grazing					Soil organic carbon		Mixed results (positive and negative)					Godard_2617_G	Fact sheet	xxxx	"Godard, LŽo"	"Pastures under fruit trees, a French example of regenerating fertility in an old orchard thanks to sheep"	AFINET									France		48.855212	2.34647	Sheep		Orchard		Other	Ungrazed orchard											PositiveHBRC1996_2618_G	Fact sheet	1996	HBRC (Hawke's Bay Regional Council)	Protecting your farm from storm damage	Environmental Topics									New Zealand		-38.655616	178.027359	Unclear		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees											Positive	Hendry_2619_G	Presentation	xxxx	"Hendry, Stewart"	Managing cattle in woodlands										UK	Scotland	56.248085	-4.509108	Cattle		Forest grazing		Pasture without trees		Livestock growth		Mixed results (negative and no effect)								Howlett2011_2621_G	Journal Article	2011	"Howlett, D.S., Moreno, G., Mosquera-Losada, M.R., Ramachandran-Nair, P.K., Nair, V.D."

Risk was specified as the mean negative deviation of farm revenue from an assumed target income of $180,000. Animal performance variables used in estimating gross margins included (mean, minimum, maximum) (a) lambing percentage (92, 87, 99), (b) wool weight-kg per stock unit (5.4, 5.1, 5.8), (c) calving percentage (85, 83, 88) and (d) bull beef carcass weight-kg (229, 208, 247). The enterprise mix of 250 ha forestry and 3,791 stock units of bull beef yielded an optimum expected net farm revenue of $497,591 with little or no downside risk. Breeding ewe and breeding cow enterprises did not contribute to the optimum enterprise mix. Using a sheep/cattle ratio of 70/30 stock units, the expected net farm revenue reduced to $348,884. The optimum enterprise mix, with this ratio, was 310 ha forestry and 3,310 stock units of bull beef and sheep. The model predicted that it would be possible to increase the expected net farm revenue to a maximum of $362,923 by increasing the acceptable downside risk and the area allocated to forestry."	54	0	399-402		New Zealand	Taranaki	-39.28	174.34	Mixture of sheep and cattle		Farm woodland		Pasture without trees												PositiveMoinat1956_2689_MA	Journal Article	1956	"Moinat, A.
