Evaluation of agroforestry options for three tree species	Proceedings of the New Zealand Grassland Association	0369-3902			"Information on tree growth rates, economic returns and the effects of trees on pasture for radiata pine [Pinus radiata], Australian blackwood [Acacia melanoxylon] and Eucalyptus fastigata were analysed to assess the economic returns of using these tree species within a hill country farming operation. Four land use alternatives for a typical North Island hill country farm were compared using published data for costs and returns. Under the assumptions made, all three species options were more profitable in the long run than sheep and beef farming. Radiata pine produced the greatest return, large increases in log prices or yields of other tree species being required to give equal profit. The results of the analysis and market information emphasise the importance of good site selection and silviculture in the production of high quality timber. For some species these requirements may not fit on-farm production systems or be economically attractive."	59		157-158	agroforestry systems; costs; pastures; pines; returns; silviculture; silvopastoral systems; trees; woody plants	New Zealand	North Island	-37.87	176.53	Mixture of sheep and cattle		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees												PositiveSudmeyer2005_215	Journal Article	2005	"Sudmeyer, R.; Flugge, F."

This paper describes the growth of crops, pastures and trees at the tree - crop interface in agroforestry systems and the economic returns from alley farming and windbreak systems using various tree - crop competition management strategies in the Esperance region of Western Australia. Severing lateral tree roots (root-pruning), harvesting mallees and allowing them to coppice, or thinning trees for sawlog regimes increased the yield of crops and pastures in the competition zone. In some instances, these increases were significant: root-pruning increased the annual return from crops grown in the competition zone of Pinus radiata by up to $548/km of the tree line at 1 site. Conversely, root-pruning reduced tree growth by 14 - 43% across all sites. Therefore, where trees provide benefits, such as shelter from damaging winds, the benefits of reduced tree - crop competition may not offset the consequent reduction in rate of tree growth. For mallee - crop alley systems on agriculturally productive soils, mallee growth rates must be high enough to compensate for crop losses in the competition zone. On less agriculturally productive soils, block-planting mallees may be more profitable than alley systems or crops without competition (sole-crops). This research has shown that competition management strategies can be used to manipulate the relative productivity of trees, crops and pasture at the tree - agriculture interface. The use of these strategies will depend on the relative economic value of tree and crop products and the value placed on other tree benefits, such as shelter and reduced groundwater recharge."	45	11	26-33		Australia		-25.274398	133.775136	Pasture without livestock		Biofuel		Pasture without trees												Mixed results (positive and negative)Sudmeyer2008_216	Journal Article	2008	"Sudmeyer, R.

During the 1980s and early 1990s it was widely believed that agroforestry offered one of the best hopes for reducing the area at risk from salinisation while improving the productivity of conventional agricultural enterprises and providing new sources of income to landholders. This paper details the hydrogeology, tree water use and the productivity of Eucalyptus globulus, crops and pastures in an agroforestry system on the south coast of Western Australia with deep sandy soils and rising groundwater. The tree-belts directly occupied 10% of the catchment and the lateral spread of outer tree roots meant recharge was effectively eliminated over 20% of the catchment. However, groundwater at the site continued to rise for 13 years after the trees were planted. Sapflow and tree growth measurements showed that the trees did not access the brackish groundwater (>500 mg/L) present over most of the site. Consequently, tree growth was relatively poor (5 m(3)/ha/yr for inner trees) and the estimated economic returns from pulpwood production were less than from agriculture. While the outer tree rows grew at 8 times the rate of inner rows, this was at the expense of reduced crop and pasture growth in the adjacent 15-20 m wide competition zone (CZ). If the area of the CZ where agricultural production was less than breakeven is considered, then the outer tree rows grew at a similar rate (expressed on an area basis) as the inner rows. This suggests there was no economic advantage in growing pulpwood in belts rather than blocks at this site. Thinning the trees to 125 stems/ha allowed improved crop and pasture production and reduced wind erosion in the CZ, and facilitated greater growth rates of the remaining trees. It remains to be determined whether increased economic returns from the trees will compensate for the cost of thinning and pruning. This study has shown that E. globulus is not a suitable agroforestry tree species for medium rainfall sites with deep sands and brackish groundwater, other tree species may be more suited to these sites and achieve better economic and hydrological outcomes for landholders.

Although mallees are planted on >12 700 ha across the south-west of Western Australia, very little commercial harvesting of mallee has occurred to date. The development of biomass processing industries is constrained by lack of robust information regarding the productivity of integrated mallee and agricultural systems. This study addresses this constraint by quantifying the productivity and economics of agricultural crops and pastures growing in the competition zone adjacent to mallee belts at 15 sites across the Western Australian wheatbelt. The sites covered a range of climate and edaphic conditions, three mallee species (Eucalyptus polybractea R Baker, E. loxophleba ssp. lissophloia LAS Johnson and KD Hill, or E. kochii ssp. plenissima (CA Gardner) Brooker), various crop and pasture rotations, and various mallee harvest-management treatments. Mallee-crop competition was negatively correlated with rainfall and positively correlated with mallee age and size, and greater for crops than pasture. Consequently, extent and magnitude of competition were highly variable across sites and years. On average, mallee-crop competition extended 11.3m from unharvested belts and reduced crop and pasture yields by 36% within 2-20m of the mallee belts relative to open paddock yields. This is similar to what has been reported for taller tree species. Harvesting mallees reduced competition such that crop and pasture yield was reduced by 22 or 27% relative to open paddock yields for mallees harvested at 3- or 6+-year intervals, respectively. The economic cost of mallee-crop competition on agricultural enterprises was also highly variable between sites, and between years within individual sites. Averaged across all site-years, the opportunity cost of competition was equivalent to forgoing agricultural production for 14.4m on each side of unharvested mallee belts, or 9-10m on each side of harvested belts. Farmers with mallee agroforestry systems will need to manage the economic impacts of competition by reducing agricultural input costs in the competition zone, timing crop-grazing rotations with mallee harvests, ensuring that the width of alleys is at least 25 times the height of the mature trees, and possibly root-pruning mallees in unharvested or long harvest interval systems. This research has shown that mallee-crop competition presents a significant cost to farmers and must be considered when designing mallee agroforestry systems. The findings have relevance for the development of appropriate biomass and carbon sequestration pricing benchmarks for mallee plantings."	63	6	140-140		Australia		-25.274398	133.775136	Pasture without livestock		Biofuel		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Negative								Unclear from articleStewart2011_230	Journal Article	2011	"Stewart, Hugh T.

An element of the policy was the development of a commercial forestry and farm forestry culture. In this context, farm forestry was intended to provide the opportunity to integrate smaller-scale plantations into agricultural landscapes on private land. Against this background, a study was undertaken to analyse the socio-economic returns from farm forestry in a case study in south-east Australia. Financial information during 1993-2007 for livestock grazing and 8 ha of blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus) was analysed to compare the profitability of farming and farm forestry. During this period, a full cycle of blue gum (14 years) to produce pulp logs was completed with a forestry company under a tree farming agreement. The blue gum was integrated with the livestock enterprise by planting the trees in belts that were mostly 10 rows or 30 m wide positioned 250-300 m apart and located strategically on productive agricultural land along land-class boundaries. For the blue gum farm forestry, the net present value to the farmer expressed in 1993 dollars was $1236/ha compared to $768/ha for livestock grazing during 1993-2007. The farmer reported they had successfully integrated farm forestry as a land-use, and that the farm forestry had provided important environmental benefits and social benefits. The farmer was committed to farm forestry being part of the diversified farming business into the future, with the management of a second crop of blue gum on the farm underway. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

For a livestock farmer who is considering establishing environmental plantings of trees for carbon sequestration, the question is 'what are the benefits and costs of growing trees instead of using that land to grow pasture to feed livestock?' In this research, the case study approach and the methods of farm management economics were applied to assess whether growing trees for carbon on part of a prime lamb case study farm in south-west Victoria could be a better use of resources than using that land to graze livestock. The question was investigated for a range of economic and environmental conditions over 25 and 100 years. A condition was that the trees provided no other benefit on farm and the required rate of return on marginal capital was 6% real (10% nominal). The results indicated that the price of carbon would need to be $AUD132/t CO(2)e for growing trees solely for carbon sequestration to be a good investment. Alternatively, if the trees provided benefits in addition to carbon credits, such as shelter for vulnerable young lambs, the investment could be worthwhile to the business at a lower carbon price. Previous research has shown that shelter (in the form of trees, grasshedge rows and other man-made structures) can reduce lamb mortality by reducing wind chill at lambing, through reduced wind speed. The benefits to a farm system from growing trees for carbon depends on the reduction in wind speed the trees create, the weather conditions, the price of lambs, the establishment cost of the trees, the price of carbon, and transaction costs. The results of this research has shown that for the representative livestock farmer, growing trees for carbon is unlikely to be as profitable as alternative uses of their resources.

When the present owners of the farm took over the property in 1975, the stream running through the farm was becoming saline and access to the lower portions of the farm was frequently hindered by water logging in the wet winter months. The paper describes the decision made by the present owners to develop a whole farm plan to ameliorate water logging and prevent the development of secondary salinity, The plan included the grading of interceptor drains with a fall of 1:300 along the contour 150-200 m apart down the slope and the locating of dams along the drains to hold water for the dry summer months. Belts of three or four species of trees were planted on the down-slope side of the drains after leveling the spoil from the drain and deep-ripping the soil. The benefits of this plan included reduced water logging, salinity and wind erosion, and increased yields, stocking rates and lambing percentages.

Nonetheless, few Studies have examined the economic profitability of these systems. This article analyses the economics of silvopastoral systems established on abandoned agricultural soils afforested with Pinus radiata D. Don. Different tree planting, densities, discounting rates, grass values and fire risk scenarios were analysed. The technique employed is based on the combination of an optimization algorithm and a simulator of stand growth and grass yield. The most profitable schedules were obtained with initial stand densities of 1500 trees per hectare. However, with high unit values of pasture production (high value of grass), schedules with an initial stand density of 500 trees per hectare were the most profitable. When the risk of fire was included in the analyses, silvopastoral systems were always more profitable than timber production systems. With an assumption that grazing reduces fire risk thinnings should be done earlier and heavier to reduce the expected losses due to fire and to promote grass production. This lengthens the pasture period. In general, rotation lengths of silvopastoral systems were shorter than in timber production."	43	5	769-773		Spain	Galicia	42.5	-8.1	Sheep		Silvopasture		Forest without grazing												PositiveParminter2001_634	Journal Article	2001	"Parminter, I.; Dodd, M.

This paper focuses on the integration of understorey crops and/or livestock within high value tree systems (e.g., apple orchards, olive groves, chestnut woodlands, and walnut plantations), and describes the components, structure, ecosystem services and economic value of ten case studies of this type of agroforestry across Europe. Although their ecological and socio-economic contexts vary, the systems share some common characteristics. The primary objective of the farmer is likely to remain the value of tree products like apples, olives, oranges, or nuts, or particularly high value timber. However there can still be production, environmental or economic benefits of integrating agricultural crops such as chickpeas and barley, or grazing an understorey grass crop with livestock. Three of the systems focused on the grazing of apple orchards with sheep in the UK and France. The introduction of sheep to apple orchards can minimise the need for mowing and provide an additional source of revenue. Throughout the Mediterranean, there is a need to improve the financial viability of olive groves. The case studies illustrate the possibility of intercropping traditional olive stands with chickpea in Greece, or the intercropping of wild asparagus in high density olive groves in Italy.

This research examined forage dry matter production and quality in six forage treatments (orchardgrass, bluegrass, brome, and perennial ryegrass bicultures with white clover; cut hay; and a control) in newly-established silvopastures and open pastures converted from an early successional northern hardwood forest in New York. In addition, we conducted a financial analysis of the establishment of both agricultural systems, as well as a thinned forest treatment managed solely for wood products. Total forage dry matter production (planted forages plus volunteer grasses) was greater in open pastures than silvopastures in the first year after establishment; however, no differences in total forage production were found between silvopastures and open pastures in June or August of the second year. Total forage dry matter production was greater in the orchardgrass-white clover biculture compared to the control treatment in both years. Orchardgrass percent crude protein was lower in open pastures (10.7%) compared to silvopastures (12.9%) in June of year two. The financial analysis indicated that silvopasture outperformed open pasture and thinned forest treatments in terms of both IRR and NPV. We conclude that forage production in silvopastures can be competitive with that in open pastures on sites with a similar, forested, starting condition."	93	1	37-43		USA	New York	44.35	-73.53	Cattle		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		No effect								PositiveOosterbaan2006_693	Journal Article	2006	"Oosterbaan, A.; Schepers, H.; Kwanten, E."

The cultivars that performed best in these trials originated from British Columbia ('Broadview') and The Netherlands ('Buccaneer'). In an agroforestry project in the East, 8 farms planted 10 ha of walnut ('Broadview', 'Buccaneer'), cherry and sweet chestnut at a spacing between 10-20 metres. The initial investment for trees, poles, wire netting to protect against animals, resulted in a low net income for the first 5 years. Thereafter, the income from the combination of walnut and quality timber with grass is reasonable and may exceed the income from subsidised, extensively managed grass. The grass production varied from 3 to 9 tons of dry matter per hectare per year. In the 4 years of investigation there was no visible evidence that the presence of the trees had influenced the composition and production of the grass vegetation. Based on predicted crown development grass production will be possible for a long period. So far, the nut production from the young plantations has not been profitable. In order to find walnuts that were better adapted to the cooler weather conditions of the North, walnuts were selected from green areas in the North and evaluated for their characteristics. This resulted in at least two cultivars ('Dionym', 'Amphyon') with excellent yield potentials together with a good external and internal quality. Both cultivars have a low susceptibility to disease and are particularly suitable for organic cultivation. 'Dionym' and 'Amphyon' are planted in private gardens but also in a commercial organic orchard of 1.5 ha in which the 200 walnut trees are grown together (mixed cropping) with hazelnuts and Sea Buckthorn."		705	438	agroforestry; dry matter; grasslands; hazelnuts; organic farming; sown grasslands; walnuts	Netherlands		52.132633	5.291266	Unclear		Silvopasture		Baseline from implementation		Understory/pasture production		No effect								Mixed results (positive and no effect)Morgan-Davies2008_813	Journal Article	2008	"Morgan-Davies, C.; Waterhouse, A.; Pollock, M.

Agroforestry can be a way to control and ameliorate the problems. The major conclusion is that pine agroforestry can be more profitable in the long term than conventional agriculture. It would be a profitable way to control and ameliorate the environmental problems in the region. It would also generate other benefits. A number of measures can be adopted to reduce or avert any problems arising from agroforestry's annual net returns (which fluctuate and are negative for most years before log sales) and annual labour requirements (which vary over time and are generally higher than those for agriculture for about the first half of the agroforestry rotation).

Wildlife-related activities as well as annual and periodic cash flows from timber and livestock sales were included in the analysis. Land expectation value (LEV), equivalent annual income (EAI), and rate of return (ROR) were compared for a silvopastoral system and four traditional southern monocultural systems. The profitability of silvopastoral systems is comparable to other land use systems. Silvopasture further provides opportunities for incorporating wildlife-related activities through hunting leases and possesses both quality and quantity of wildlife habitat not available in other systems. On average, the inclusion of hunting leases increases LEVs from 3.1 to 30.6% per acre over a range of lease and interest rates.

Farmer perceptions of risk and profitability of best management practices are key determinants of adoption, which traditional incentive programs like the Environmental Quality Incentive Program attempt to address by providing financial and technical support. To ensure that payments offered through these programs that maximize adoption, regional incentive payments must be based upon locally established costs.

Specifically, three CCBMPs for Vermont are examined: cover cropping, management intensive rotational grazing (MIRG), and riparian buffer strips. Results show the average cost for cover cropping is $129.24/acre, MIRG is $79.82/acre, and a tree based riparian buffer strip cost $807.33/acre.

Recent shelterbelt research in New Zealand has been conducted as a collaborative approach by AgResearch, Forest Research and Hort Research. Results of pasture, soil and tree measurements in the East Coast region indicate that shelterbelts, however managed, do not significantly increase pasture production in the sheltered zone. The competitive effects of trees reduce soil moisture in zones close to the shelter, which also encourages the accumulation of dung and urine nutrients in this zone by animals seeking protection. The modification in resting patterns as a result of shelter may be reflected in improved animal welfare and production but this was not measured.

At a European scale, the UK is one of the countries with the lowest woodland cover, currently extending to only 13% of the total land area of the UK, this is less than half of the European Union (EU) average of 37 per cent. A significant study carried out by Read et al. (2009) identified that UK wide there is a need to increase significantly levels of new planting and forest creation by more than 23,000 ha each year over the next 40 years if a substantial influence on reversing climate change is to be realised. It is clear that expansion of the total forested area in the UK necessitates the establishment of new woodland and forest cover on farmland which is either owner occupied or rented out. The main barriers to woodland establishment on farmland cited in the literature, include cultural resistance notably a dichotomous view of farming and forestry as being competing land uses; and lack of awareness of the potential economic benefits of woodland. This study intended to provide information that will improve farmers and landowners understanding of the potential economic differences between business as usual (sheep farming) and woodland creation in the uplands of the UK. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bio-economic potentials of temperate upland clear fell forestry systems in the UK over the last 60 years and determine if afforestation of upland farms has historically produced, and will in the future produce better financial outcomes than conventional upland sheep farming. The study used a bio-economic model based on discounted cash flow analysis to compare and evaluate a conventional upland sheep grazing system against a temperate upland forestry system. Historic investments to cease upland sheep grazing and afforest upland farms in the UK based on historic financial budgeting information available to farmers and landowners in 1956, 1976 would not have been an economically viable and profitable land use change compared to continuation of upland sheep grazing in the UK. Historic markets in 1956 and 1976 were not strong enough to render potential forestry investments profitable without a need for grant assistance. Investments to cease upland sheep grazing and afforest upland farms in the UK in 1996 would have been economically viable and profitable land use investment as timber markets alone were strong enough to render potential forestry investment profitable without a need for grant assistance. Without subsidy, investments to switch from upland sheep grazing and afforest upland farms in 2016 would not be an economically viable and profitable land use change.

In general, these woodlands are not managed specifically for timber or cattle benefits. This lack of management often leads to decreased timber value and reduced forage yields. Silvopasture is a potential alternative to overcome this lack of land management on Minnesota woodlots. However, very limited information are available about silvopasture use in Minnesota. This three-year study evaluated the potential for silvopasture in Minnesota by comparing the production of unmanaged woodland grazing, silvopastoral, and open pasture systems. Three farmers from Central Minnesota collaborated in this study to assess these grazing systems. Silvopasture paddocks were established when thinning and seeding were performed on woodland areas. We assessed forage production, forage quality, and livestock performance. Forage production was generally greater in silvopastoral systems compared with unmanaged woodland grazing systems, while forage quality was lower in open pasture systems, at least during the first year. Livestock performance was similar between the grazing systems. Results indicate that silvopasture has potential in Minnesota, but more research is required to develop specific management guidelines as well as to monitor silvopasture production systems for longer periods of time."	93	1	57-66		USA	Minnesota	46.05	-94.9	Cattle		Silvopasture		Forest without grazing		Multiple	"Total productivity, livestock growth"	Mixed results (positive and negative)								PositiveEckersley1994_1728	Journal Article	1994	"Eckersley, P."

Using the model, an assessment has been made of the implications of varying the density and the planting pattern of the trees on the combined income from the sale of wood and livestock over a number of years. The resultant incomes have been compared with that from an equivalent unafforested area to assess the likely economic implications of intercropping trees with grass. At a discount rate of 5%, the indications are that combining wood and sheep meat production on the same area could be financially attractive. At higher discount rates, the economic attraction of growing trees is more dependent on an increase in timber prices relative to those prevailing at present. However, given the large number of assumptions necessitated by the limited availability of data and in the absence of any means of validating the model, extreme care is needed in interpreting the results. Confident economic projections of the value of intercropping trees with grass await further experimental work on appropriate growth models for open-grown trees, light interception, tree rooting patterns and water uptake of tree roots."	21	1	65-68	Agroforestry; broadleaves; economics; Farm forestry; grasslands; intercropping; models; Silvopastoral systems; simulation; simulation models; trees; woody plants	UK		51.46	-0.97	Sheep		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees		Multiple	"Total productivity, livestock growth"	Mixed results (positive and negative)								Mixed results (positive and negative)Dominati2014_1792	Journal Article	2014	"Dominati, E.

The influence of space-planted trees, a soil conservation practice, on the provision of services, was also assessed. The economic value of the services provided by an uneroded steep pasture grazed by sheep and cattle was estimated at NZD 3717 ha(-1) yr(-1). This value dropped by 65% when the topsoil was lost in a single shallow mass movement. Fifty years after erosion, the services only recovered to 61% of uneroded value. In contrast, the same landscape type planted with soil conservation trees provided, after 20 years, additional (+22% in dollar value) services from the similar unprotected landscape. A benefit cost analysis of soil conservation practices showed planting conservation frees is only profitable if the frees are harvested for Limber (age 20), and low discount rates (< 5%) are used. When the economic value of the extra services from conservation trees is included in the BCA, the Net Present Value of the investment is greatly positive at discount rates ranging from 0% to 10%.

The group included representation from landowners, government agencies and scientists. The group was facilitated through an action research approach incorporating three phases: (1) awareness; (2) forecasting; and (3) implementation. The group identified a set of goals and indicators relevant to achieving a ""well managed rural hill catchment"" The indicators were used to (a) assess the current state of the catchment farm in relation to the goals; (b) evaluate a range of strategies for improving system performance and (c) evaluate progress toward the goals following land use changes implemented within the catchment farm. Key issues for the group included the availability of data and the setting of appropriate performance benchmarks. From both economic and environmental points of view, the existing farm system was failing to meet the goals set by the management group. Key factors driving these outcomes included the physical and productivity limitations of the soil resource, poor livestock performance and poor water quality. A mixture of research observations, decision support models and expert stakeholder knowledge indicated scope for improving performance through forestry, riparian management, erosion control and livestock intensification options. Based on their evaluation of the forecasting results, the group developed a new land use plan, which depended on significant capital investment in land use and enterprise change. Subsequent monitoring of soils, vegetation, water quality, animal production and financial results over four years showed marked improvement in a number of key performance indicators. In particular, sediment and phosphorus loads and faecal coliform levels decreased rapidly, native forest fragments showed early signs of restoration, lamb and beef productivity increased and the per hectare financial returns of the pastoral component increased. Better matching of land use to land capability has led to short-term improvement in some aspects of the economic and environmental performance of the catchment farm. Progress toward a more sustainable agricultural system was achieved, but at a substantial cost for transformation of the biophysical system, which has implications for the wider sector.

Current recommendations to farmers are to plant tree on the less productive areas of the farm and adopt a tree stocking rate which fully utilises the site."	62		203-208	agroforestry; farm forestry; livestock farming; pines; silvopastoral systems; trees; woody plants	New Zealand	Akatore	-46.13	170.11	Mixture of sheep and cattle		Wood pasture		Baseline from implementation		Total productivity (pasture + trees)		Mixed results (positive and negative)								PositiveCoelho2012_1956	Journal Article	2012	"Coelho, Marta Baptista; Paulo, Joana Amaral; Nunes Palma, Joao Henrique; Tome, Margarida"	Contribution of cork oak plantations installed after 1990 in Portugal to the Kyoto commitments and to the landowners economy	Forest Policy and Economics	1389-9341	10.1016/j.forpol.2011.10.005	<Go to ISI>://WOS:000302986600009; https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/272157/1-s2.0-S1389934112X00030/1-s2.0-S1389934111001845/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEAIaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIQC8qc3LNGmDeDT83miYg1tRVNrx%2F2B3FlR%2FkgpgkUIY0QIgMcSQj2A%2F4ivItqyZXN4JFyuUlYM%2BU1kLkgETljpegi0qvQMIuv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARACGgwwNTkwMDM1NDY4NjUiDPFxRCgr9lZttKK4MiqRA3rvdJ0iteFh%2BjksRqlnNnR9Kz2MwSNiRd%2B5PRAWq9qJCvm%2FywWUDqUNhx%2F9hU1SQOiC9GPYqrAlxDInHoz29UwYqK3nGGrM9itrtJiTmwmJATWMjbeUSiOqbHtWEqxIkFLmev6%2FUGCHgbTFbk80fkippB0FfhJLVym4ot4ke4tQ52BrsGGiHroOiJxhDqUCYZidDUWhe%2BihO8usXefDckkXKm4YC3PIZfFRY5eOHEMjSH7902hqmKpmK0xhki7IyM18yS957mUHjy05U2YwL3pEHFFntm0EtOY2dipYOoy0LH35mzq1LxgMbyaPx1ArRjiXGWSiSGqKoeJjDKi5He2R2syLN1G%2FelHQnm0OF6IlpLmxiECqD3ll%2Bcx74jVdSGulLr7VJ%2BBs6aJtoALIpwz7H8tC1W19YP3BHvq1F%2FfQYjHwSlCxUBbrh2toEt1ngmrAp0Ef9FV9WVgEzTZovISChTMNM1b237K5l%2BeR6eZc7CJ2XTXlMsvFaxaJMwb0NQMCrQwg9Cdwsd0CFhPfeMNDMMa1qfIFOusBf85ZL%2FDTY0ol3ZrAAPyTvjuvaeBBK2H4%2FkqVBidn1vyciIWj0RbMXnZn1VFlITHXYhOCBF9N2b0Jk1xL%2BsBwq5kaMf0oDjfoY0HTl%2BhmuEGAQf%2FBaYeaZ7ul%2BBR4zndMl%2BN1sWW2HyGcmI4%2BdRZSpdPSpcCEyfb3Zo092bfaegIqF5hBp4JBfJllVYyBFGF7c%2FiJ9bfxBfpSfOMaY34gJI4rP3f9Ba34F%2FUWKpwLv50CxHuhfZJzVxawsRhcAPisDGk69TruTaRB%2BCTwAwWCtzk4ofwZgXoc8Aq1eP36OhB0%2BvPzgNGErwFNCg%3D%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20200217T100427Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTY44ZQJADJ%2F20200217%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=7103cd2d2f13a4a1c2baf6ebd93c2aca48ef184353d24c684b5b93af0497608a&hash=250af36226729072d20aead5adcf338ce46b163e9f184596b596f1b0c30d1b9c&host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&pii=S1389934111001845&tid=spdf-cb597918-8177-4b17-8c90-2667580ca613&sid=6600d5da1884e6475a2a85b800c96bdc5469gxrqb&type=client	"Cork oak stands are a part of the agroforestry ecosystem in Portugal, characterized by a low crown cover from cork oak trees, managed towards cork production, and sometimes in combination with grazing. In recent years, European Union policies gave impetus to a large area of new cork oak plantations, which have been established mainly for cork production purposes, and consequently with higher stand density than traditional agroforestry systems. These plantations are important not only for cork production but also for the carbon sequestered by these slow growing forests that won't be harvested for wood production. Thinning operations will be needed to avoid excessive inter-tree competition and wood extracted from these thinning may also provide income for the owners. In the present study, carbon sequestered and wood volumes resulting from thinning were estimated for the next 70 years. Three scenarios of different annual afforestation rates and different site indexes were tested. The resulting values for the considered scenarios show that, if the plantation rates are maintained, new cork oak plantations will have an important contribution to the Portuguese commitments to providing CO2 offsets under the Kyoto protocol. Additionally, due to the increasing values of initial density in new cork plantations, cork oak forests will produce a significant volume of wood that may become an important contribution to the landowners' income.

GHG emissions per kilogram meat in the economic optimum differ between the production systems and range from 18 to 21.9 kg CO2-eq./kg meat. Only GHG offset by agroforestry systems showed the potential to significantly reduce these emissions. Depending on the production system agroforestry systems could reduce net GHG emissions by 66% to 7.3 kg CO2-eq./kg meat in the most intensive system and by 100% in the most extensive system.

Trees can assist in catchment management, and re-afforestation strategies have been implemented in an effort to mitigate agricultural impacts and improve degraded land and waterways worldwide. Re-afforestation strategies often target private land, and their success relies on landholder participation. Landholders' decisions about land-use allocation are driven primarily by the private financial costs and benefits associated with different farming strategies. This research assesses the private on-farm financial impact and the public environmental benefit of land use transition from beef grazing to a mixed beef grazing-forestry system in the Richmond River catchment on the east coast of Australia. GIS analysis identified more than 30% of the catchment as beef grazing land potentially available for re-afforestation, across a variety of soil types and geomorphic characteristics. We used a farm-scale financial model to assess the costs and benefits associated with transition from grazing to a variety of cattle-forestry mixtures that were determined on the basis of their suitability to soil type and slope in different parts of a catchment. We also used a multi-criteria approach to assess the environmental outcomes associated with each transition. The results demonstrate that diversification to a mixed beef grazing-forestry system consistently provides environmental benefit, but the financial impact on landholders varies depending on soil type. Landholders on ferrosol and vertosol soils in this catchment have favourable options that can simultaneously deliver private and public benefits, whereas landholders on kurosol and dermosol soils are more restricted, with environmental improvements possible only as a trade-off with farm financial performance. Based on these results, we suggest that different policy mechanisms are required to encourage graziers in different parts of the catchment to shift towards mixed cattle-forestry systems."	87		25-pp		Australia	New South Wales	-28.87	153.59	Cattle		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees		Multiple	"Total productivity, livestock growth "	Positive								Mixed results (positive and negative)Ahlgren1946_2365	Journal Article	1946	"Ahlgren, H.

Breeding ewe and breeding cow enterprises did not contribute to the optimum enterprise mix. Using a sheep/cattle ratio of 70/30 stock units, the expected net farm revenue reduced to $348,884. The optimum enterprise mix, with this ratio, was 310 ha forestry and 3,310 stock units of bull beef and sheep. The model predicted that it would be possible to increase the expected net farm revenue to a maximum of $362,923 by increasing the acceptable downside risk and the area allocated to forestry."	54	0	399-402		New Zealand	Taranaki	-39.28	174.34	Mixture of sheep and cattle		Farm woodland		Pasture without trees												Positive
