Analysis of dry matter yields in the third year	Agroforestry Systems	0167-4366	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00711572		"Dry matter yield (DM), and water use and light interception, were determined in an agroforestry trial near Lincoln, New Zealand, consisting of Pinus radiata grown over (1) control (bare ground), (2) ryegrass/clovers (Lolium perenne/Trifolium spp.), (3) ryegrass only, and (4) lucerne (Medicago sativa), during the third growing season between 1992 and 1993. In addition these pastures were grown alone in separate plots in the open. Pasture yields during the one-year period in the agroforestry plots were little affected by the presence of trees although there were seasonal trends: yields were generally unaffected or increased in summer, but reduced in spring as a result of tree shade. Total pasture yield during the one-year period was in the following order: lucerne > ryegrass/clover > ryegrass. This trend was the exact opposite of that shown by the above-ground tree weight which was reduced in the pasture ground covers by 16-52%. The reduction in tree weights was associated with reduced soil moisture availability arising from competition with the pasture species. Thus the relationship between the yields of trees and pasture species in the agroforestry plot was reciprocal. The combined DM for both the trees and pastures in the agroforestry plots during the one-year period was in the following order: lucerne (20 t/ha) > ryegrass/clover (16 t) > ryegrass (11 t) > control (6 t). These results are consistent with the total water used and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) intercepted. The trees accounted for 55, 44, 34 and 24% of water used respectively in control, ryegrass, ryegrass/clover and lucerne ground covers. The balance was largely accounted for by pasture transpiration, except in the control where soil evaporation was significant. The fraction of intercepted PAR accounted for by the trees followed a similar trend to that of the water used. The crop coefficient for water use efficiency (k) (Pa) was 2.3 for radiata pine, 3.6 for ryegrass/clover, 2.8 for ryegrass and 4.8 for lucerne. The DM produced per unit of water used (kg mm-1 ha-1) during the one-year period was 24.5 for radiata pine, 41.1 for lucerne, 30.0 for ryegrass/clovers and 23.1 for ryegrass. Radiation use efficiency (g DM MJ-1 m-2) was 1.33 for pine, 1.83 for ryegrass/clover, 1.49 for ryegrass and 2.34 for lucerne. The land equivalent ratio (LER, the sum of ratios of DM produced by the plant species in the agroforestry plots to those produced in the sole plots) was 1.95 for ryegrass, 1.71 for ryegrass/clover and 1.46 for lucerne. These results indicate the susceptibility of the pasture species to shading and interception of rainfall by the tree crowns (aboveground interactions), and of the trees to competition for soil moisture (underground interaction)."	32	2		agroforestry; agroforestry systems; biomass production; dry matter; farming systems; ground cover; interception; light; light penetration; lucerne; pastures; pines; plant competition; plant water relations; silvopastoral systems; soil water; transpiration; trees; use efficiency; water potential; water use; water use efficiency; woody plants; yields	New Zealand	South Island	-43.65	172.49	Pasture without livestock		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		No effect								Woods1982_40	Journal Article	1982	"Woods, R.

Factors contributing to differences in forage yield in the semi-arid woodlands	Australian Rangeland Journal	0313-4555			"A series of experimental sites, which were all on the same land unit but which differed in present condition, were established in the semiarid woodlands near Cobar, New South Wales. The forage yield on these plots was measured quarterly over a 2-year period. Associated measurements were made of species composition, forage quality, shrub and tree cover, area of eroded surface and soil fertility (available P, organic C, organic N and available N). Mean forage yield varied from 34 to 237 kg/ha. A major proportion of this variation was explained by total shrub and tree cover, organic N and organic C in the surface soil. Differences in N content were considered to have arisen by differential erosion, but this was more accurately characterized by laboratory measures than by field observations of the extent of soil erosion. Some differences were recorded in the composition of the herbaceous layer between plots, including a dominance of perennial grasses such as Danthonia caespitosa and Enteropogon acicularis on plots that had been excluded from grazing. However, nearly all species were edible so that composition differences were not a major contributor to variation in digestible forage yield. Perennial forbs (e.g. Sclerolaena diacantha) had the highest digestibility and biennial grasses (e.g. Stipa variabilis) the lowest. Total shrub and tree cover and the extent and severity of erosion are recommended as the most useful variables for monitoring changes in pastoral productivity of the semiarid woodlands."	10	1		agroforestry; estimation; forage; forests; Grasslands; semiarid zones; Silvopastoral systems; techniques; woodland grasslands; yields	Australia	New South Wales	-31.48	145.23	Unclear		Wood pasture		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Decrease with increased tree density/cover/proximity								Walpole1999_114	Journal Article	1999	"Walpole, S.

Assessment of the economic and ecological impacts of remnant vegetation on pasture productivity	Pacific Conservation Biology	1038-2097		<Go to ISI>://BCI:BCI200000242481	"The decline of remnant native vegetation in Australia is a national concern, with mounting community pressure on private landholders to actively manage and conserve the remaining vegetation on their properties. One of the major concerns of landholders in retaining and managing remnant vegetation in the agricultural landscape is the lack of information and understanding about the costs and benefits potentially associated with remnant vegetation, and how these values are linked to ecological functions. This paper focuses on the impacts of remnant vegetation on pasture productivity. Knowledge of the economic impacts of remnant vegetation on pasture productivity and associated agricultural output is currently limited, while the ecological relationships are better known but may vary with species and environment. Based on a study area near Gunnedah in northern New South Wales where farm survey data and GIS information were available, a model that incorporates agricultural and biophysical attributes to explain pasture productivity was developed. The results indicate that the value of pasture output per farm may be increased by having a certain proportion of pasture area under dry sclerophyll or woodland vegetation. Gross value of pasture output was at its highest level when the proportion of tree area across the farm was at 34%, with no further increases in output being achieved beyond this point. These results suggest that the competitive influences of trees present in the pasture system may begin to outweigh the stimulatory effects when this proportion of tree area is exceeded."	5	1			Australia	New South Wales	-31	150.08	Sheep		Silvopasture		Other	Different densities of trees	Understory/pasture production		Decrease with increased tree density/cover/proximity								Wall2010_115	Journal Article	2010	"Wall, Andrew J.; Kemp, Peter D.; Mackay, Alec D.; Power, Ian L."

As an indirect measure of PAR transmission, diffuse non-intercepted radiation (DIFN) levels underneath fully foliated poplar stands were measured in two climatically contrasting regions of the North Island of New Zealand. The ability of several easily measured stand inventory parameters to predict understorey DIFN was then evaluated using regression analysis. Pasture net herbage accumulation (NHA) was also measured below the fully foliated trees and related to understorey DIFN. A directly inverse relationship between DIFN in the gap between tree crowns and stand canopy closure measured with a standard digital camera was found to be the simplest, most accurate and robust of the stand parameters examined. In comparison, there were site differences in the relationship for this understorey environment for all of the stand parameters based on individual tree metrics. Site differences in the relationship for DIFN directly underneath the tree-crowns were also apparent for both the stand parameters based on individual tree metrics and digital photographs. Inter-site variation in these relationships was attributed to unaccounted differences in stand leaf area. There was a strong straight-line relationship between DIFN and understorey pasture NHA.

Predicting pasture production under poplars using canopy closure images	Proceedings of the New Zealand Grassland Association	0369-3902			"Poplar trees serve a wide variety of purposes on New Zealand farms. Their high growth rate and ability to establish from poles make them a very suitable tree species for soil conservation plantings on erosion-prone hill pastures. The impact that such plantings have on understorey pasture production as the tree canopy develops in size was determined by measuring pasture dry matter (DM) production on three North Island sheep and beef hill farms. Poplars markedly reduced annual pasture production by up to 50% at high canopy closure. To maintain pasture production at 65-75% of uneroded open pasture, poplar canopy closure should not exceed 50%. However, it must be emphasised that the loss in production through soil erosion (e.g. slips or earthflows) without poplars can be even greater, more permanent, and much more unpredictable."	68			agroforestry systems; agropastoral systems; canopy; dry matter; erosion; erosion control; grazing; poplars; soil conservation; trees; understorey; woody plants	New Zealand	North Island	-40.1	175.73	Pasture without livestock		Silvopasture		Other	Gradient in stand densities selected to fit model	Understory/pasture production		Decrease with increased tree density/cover/proximity								Veissier2018_139	Journal Article	2018	"Veissier, I.; Laer, E. van; Palme, R.; Moons, C.

We aimed at evaluating in a temperate region (Belgium) to what extent cattle may suffer from heat stress (measured through body temperature, respiration rate and panting score, cortisol or its metabolites in milk, and feces on hot days) and at assessing the potential benefits of shade. During the summer of 2012, 20 cows were kept on pasture without access to shade. During the summer of 2011, ten cows had access to shade (young trees with shade cloth hung between them), whereas ten cows had no access. Climatic conditions were quantified by the Heat Load Index (HLI). In animals without access to shade respiration rates, panting scores, rectal temperatures, and milk cortisol concentrations increased as HLI increased in both 2011 and 2012. Fecal cortisol metabolites varied with HLI in 2011 only. When cattle had access to shade, their use of shade increased as the HLI increased. This effect was more pronounced during the last part of the summer, possibly due to better acquaintance with the shade construction. In this case, shade use increased to 65% at the highest HLI (79). Shade tempered the effects on respiration, rectal temperature, and fecal cortisol metabolites. Milk cortisol was not influenced by HLI for cows using shade for >10% of the day. Therefore, even in temperate areas, cattle may suffer from heat when they are at pasture in summer and providing shade can reduce such stress."	62	4		blood chemistry; body temperature; cows; dairy cattle; dairy cows; faeces composition; heat stress; hydrocortisone; metabolites; milk; milk composition; respiration rate; shade; shade plants; shade trees; stress; stress response; summer; temperate climate; temperate zones; trees; woody plants	Belgium		50.86	3.47	Cattle		Shelterbelt/Windbreak	Block of trees with shade cloth	Pasture without trees		Livestock heat stress		Positive								Varella2011_147	Journal Article	2011	"Varella, A.

It produces a continuous, uniform reduced light environment. Shade cloth and a slatted structure were compared in relation to the inability to represent the light regime and plant responses of an agroforestry system. The split-split-plot randomised block experiment had main plots as covering status (with or without radiata pine trees), subplots as artificial shade (none, shade cloth or wooden slats) and sub-subplots as growth rotation, over sown alfalfa, in three replicates. The quantity of light transmittance was 49% under trees, 41% under cloth and 44% under slats. Temporal changes and spectral composition under trees were more accurately reproduced under the slats than shade cloth. The red to far red ratio was 0.64 under tree shade and 0.74 during the shaded period under slats. This compared with 1.31 in open pasture, 1.28 under shade cloth in open and 1.26 under slats during sunny periods. To compensate for low light quantity and quality, alfalfa had elongated stems and internodes. In open pasture and under cloth in the open, it produced short stems. The mean dry matter yield under trees was 68% of the 30.3 t ha(-1) in open pasture, 56% under cloth and 57% under slats. The slats induced similar morphological responses in alfalfa to those in the agroforestry system. The magnitude of changes had little effect on growth and yield responses. The artificial slatted structure approximated the intermittent light environment and consequent plant responses observed in an agroforestry system."	81	2			New Zealand	Canterbury	-43.39	172.28	Pasture without livestock		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Negative								Varela2017_148	Journal Article	2017	"Varela, S.; Caballe, G.; Diez, J.; Godoy, M.; Willems, P."

This coverage level is achieved by applying pruning and strong thinning to reduce the volume of timber production per area unit. From an economic standpoint, in order to not reduce the income level of the system, it is necessary to find tree species that could replace ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and maximize income per volume unit of wood. We evaluated the feasibility of implementation of five broadleaved tree species (native and exotic) with higher intrinsic wood quality than ponderosa pine. We tested the influence of tree cover generated by a framework of silvopastoral plantation on the increase in survival, regrowth and absolute increase in height, and compared ecophysiological variables (net photosynthetic activity, stomatal conductance, intrinsic water use efficiency) of different species to the status of a traditional plantation without tree cover. Additionally values of air temperature and relative humidity were registered under both cover conditions. Preliminary results support the conclusion that three of these five species could be considered as alternatives to ponderosa pine species for establishing silvopastoral systems with higher timber value. Our Based on the results, the use of tree cover generated under the current plantations of P. ponderosa could increase the success of the establishment of these species."	91	5			Argentina		-39.38	-71.1	Pasture without livestock		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Mixed results (positive and no effect)								Van Laer2015_154	Journal Article	2015	"Van Laer, E.; Tuyttens, F.

During the summer of 2012, a herd of Holstein cows was kept on pasture without access to shade (treatment NS). During the summers of 2011 and 2013, the herd was divided into a group with (treatment S) and a group without (treatment NS) access to shade. Shade was provided by young trees combined with shade cloths (80% reduction in solar radiation). A weather station registered the local climatic conditions on open pasture, from which we calculated daily average Heat Load Index (HLI) values. The effects of HLI and shade on rectal temperature (RT), blood plasma indicators of hyperventilation and metabolic changes due to heat stress, milk yield and milk composition were investigated. RT increased with increasing HLI, but was less for S cows than for NS cows (by 0.02 degrees C and 0.03 degrees C increase per unit increase of HLI, respectively). Hyperchloraemia (an increased blood plasma concentration of Cl-), a sign of hyperventilation, increased for NS cows but not for S cows. The plasma concentration of alkaline phosphatase, a regulator of energy metabolism in the liver, decreased with increasing HLI for NS cows only. Access to shade, thus, reduced the effect of HLI on RT, hyperchloraemia and the regulation of metabolism by the liver. As HLI increased, the plasma concentration of cholesterol decreased (indicating increased lipolysis) and the plasma concentration of creatinine increased (indicating increased protein catabolism). These effects did not differ between S and NS cows. For NS cows, after a lag-time of 2 days, the milk yield decreased with increasing HLI. For S cows, the milk yield was unaffected by HLI and its quadratic factor. The milk concentrations of lactose, protein and fat decreased as HLI increased, but only the effect on milk protein content was remediated by shade. In conclusion, access to shade tempered the negative effects of high HLI on RT, hyperchloraemia and a blood plasma indicator of changing energy metabolism (generally) as well as prevented the decrease in milk yield observed in cows without access to shade."	9	9			Belgium		50.59	3.46	Cattle		Shelterbelt/Windbreak	Block of trees with shade cloth	Pasture without trees		Milk yield		Positive								Van Laer2015_155	Journal Article	2015	"Van Laer, E.; Moons, C.

During the summer of 2012, both herds were kept on pasture without access to shade (NS). During the summers of 2011 and 2013 each herd was divided into one group with (S) and one without (NS) access to shade. Shade was provided by young trees with shade cloth (80% reduction in solar radiation) hung between them. For S cows, we investigated how shade use was related to hot conditions as quantified by six climatic indices. The heat load index (HLI), which incorporates air temperature and humidity, solar radiation and wind speed, was the best predictor of the six indices tested. In 2011, there was a relatively high threshold for use of shade. When HLI = 90, shade use probability reached 17% for dairy cows and 27% for beef cows. In 2013, however, at HLI = 90, shade use probability reached 48% for dairy cows and 41% for beef cows. For animals from the NS treatment we determined the effect of hot summer conditions on RR and PS (with 0 = no panting and 4.5 = extreme panting). In both types of cattle, an increase in black globe temperature was the best predictor for increasing RR and PS. Furthermore, we determined how the effect of hot summer conditions on RR and PS was affected by the use of shade. Under hot conditions (black globe temperature >= 30 degrees C), >50% of the animals under shade retained normal PS and RR (PS < 1 and RR < 90 breaths per minute), whereas normal RR and PS were significantly less prevalent for animals outside shade. Our findings suggest that, even in temperate summers, heat can induce thermal discomfort in cattle, as evidenced by increases in shade use, RR and PS, and that shade increases thermal comfort."	9	9			Belgium		50.59	3.46	Cattle	Both dairy and beef cattle	Shelterbelt/Windbreak	Block of trees with shade cloth	Pasture without trees		Livestock heat stress		Positive								Valtorta1997_157	Journal Article	1997	"Valtorta, S.

This paper reviews trends and possibilities in landscape-management both in specific locations and countrywide. In addition to the agroforestry potential there are examples of conservation, landscape protection and ethnic heritage of these farming methods. Because of changes in land structure and the accession of Hungary to the EU, the economic objectives of afforestation are increasing. The protective functions of forests as shelterbelts, landscape enhancement and settlement-protection are also being felt. It is expected to be an increase in shelterbelts, windbreaks, forest belts, hedgerows and alleys. Surveys in forest, and non-forest scenarios need to be followed by long term planning, which should increase forest protection.

Sapflow and tree growth measurements showed that the trees did not access the brackish groundwater (>500 mg/L) present over most of the site. Consequently, tree growth was relatively poor (5 m(3)/ha/yr for inner trees) and the estimated economic returns from pulpwood production were less than from agriculture. While the outer tree rows grew at 8 times the rate of inner rows, this was at the expense of reduced crop and pasture growth in the adjacent 15-20 m wide competition zone (CZ). If the area of the CZ where agricultural production was less than breakeven is considered, then the outer tree rows grew at a similar rate (expressed on an area basis) as the inner rows. This suggests there was no economic advantage in growing pulpwood in belts rather than blocks at this site. Thinning the trees to 125 stems/ha allowed improved crop and pasture production and reduced wind erosion in the CZ, and facilitated greater growth rates of the remaining trees. It remains to be determined whether increased economic returns from the trees will compensate for the cost of thinning and pruning. This study has shown that E. globulus is not a suitable agroforestry tree species for medium rainfall sites with deep sands and brackish groundwater, other tree species may be more suited to these sites and achieve better economic and hydrological outcomes for landholders.

The extent and cost of mallee-crop competition in unharvested carbon sequestration and harvested mallee biomass agroforestry systems	Crop & Pasture Science	1836-0947	10.1071/cp12129	<Go to ISI>://WOS:000308876900007	"Mallee-based agroforestry has potential to provide farmers with new income sources derived from biofuels, biofeedstocks, and carbon sequestration. Although mallees are planted on >12 700 ha across the south-west of Western Australia, very little commercial harvesting of mallee has occurred to date. The development of biomass processing industries is constrained by lack of robust information regarding the productivity of integrated mallee and agricultural systems. This study addresses this constraint by quantifying the productivity and economics of agricultural crops and pastures growing in the competition zone adjacent to mallee belts at 15 sites across the Western Australian wheatbelt. The sites covered a range of climate and edaphic conditions, three mallee species (Eucalyptus polybractea R Baker, E. loxophleba ssp. lissophloia LAS Johnson and KD Hill, or E. kochii ssp. plenissima (CA Gardner) Brooker), various crop and pasture rotations, and various mallee harvest-management treatments. Mallee-crop competition was negatively correlated with rainfall and positively correlated with mallee age and size, and greater for crops than pasture. Consequently, extent and magnitude of competition were highly variable across sites and years. On average, mallee-crop competition extended 11.3m from unharvested belts and reduced crop and pasture yields by 36% within 2-20m of the mallee belts relative to open paddock yields. This is similar to what has been reported for taller tree species. Harvesting mallees reduced competition such that crop and pasture yield was reduced by 22 or 27% relative to open paddock yields for mallees harvested at 3- or 6+-year intervals, respectively. The economic cost of mallee-crop competition on agricultural enterprises was also highly variable between sites, and between years within individual sites. Averaged across all site-years, the opportunity cost of competition was equivalent to forgoing agricultural production for 14.4m on each side of unharvested mallee belts, or 9-10m on each side of harvested belts. Farmers with mallee agroforestry systems will need to manage the economic impacts of competition by reducing agricultural input costs in the competition zone, timing crop-grazing rotations with mallee harvests, ensuring that the width of alleys is at least 25 times the height of the mature trees, and possibly root-pruning mallees in unharvested or long harvest interval systems. This research has shown that mallee-crop competition presents a significant cost to farmers and must be considered when designing mallee agroforestry systems. The findings have relevance for the development of appropriate biomass and carbon sequestration pricing benchmarks for mallee plantings."	63	6	140-140		Australia		-25.274398	133.775136	Pasture without livestock		Biofuel		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Negative								Unclear from articleSmith1942_264	Journal Article	1942	"Smith, R.

Canopy structure data were collected by destructive sampling of trees removed from the experimental area immediately prior to its establishment, and from subsequent measurements on growing trees during the following 2 years. In New Zealand, it was found that relative pasture yield (the ratio of growth below a canopy to open pasture growth) was linearly related to green crown length in the case of Pinus radiata canopies. More recently, a family of relationships between relative pasture yield and green crown length, indexed by the mean height of trees forming the canopy has been derived. For our data, the regression of annual herbage yield on green crown length is good (R2 = 92.5%) but shows systematic variation in the residuals. Hence, other related explanatory variables were investigated to see if any gave a more satisfactory fit to the data. By assuming that individual trees have a canopy in the shape of a regular cone, the areas of the projections of the tree canopies at different inclinations to the vertical were calculated. If it is further assumed that the canopies are of even density, the projections can be used to estimate the proportion of direct light which is incident on the herbage under the trees as a function of the angle of the sun above the horizon. A regression using both vertical and horizontal projections in varying proportions indicated that the best fit to the data was obtained using the horizontal projection alone (R2 = 94.0%). These results indicate: first, that the horizontal projection of the crown gives a good, simple prediction of annual herbage yield; and secondly, that the horizontal component of incident light is most important for herbage growth at Scottish latitudes."	65	02-Mar	585-595		New Zealand		-40.900557	174.885971	Pasture without livestock		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Decrease with increased tree density/cover/proximity								Sibbald2001_299	Journal Article	2001	"Sibbald, A.

A national network experiment was set up on four sites, each representative of a UK grassland farming area, with three replicates of common treatments: sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) at two silvopastoral planting densities [100 (S100) and 400 (S400) stems ha(-1)] protected by tree shelters and an agricultural control (ACONT) all with grazing sheep; a woodland control (WCONT, 2500 trees ha(-1)) without grazing. Common management protocols were applied and common measurements recorded. Results are provided for the first six years. There were no significant differences between S100, S400 and ACONT in agricultural productivity, though there were significant differences between sites (P < 0.001).

Farmers need information on pasture production and quality in order to assess the direct effect of tree presence on the productivity of their pastoral system, and to devise management that balances farm production and profitability with sustainable soil management. The main objectives of this work were (1) to evaluate tree influence on soil and pasture parameters and (2) to evaluate the use of proximal sensing techniques that have potential for monitoring aspects related to spatial and temporal variability of pasture productivity and quality in montado ecosystems. Both objectives can support the decision-making process of the farmer. The study field is located in Mitra farm, in Southern Portugal. During October 2015, 24 geo-referenced composite soil samples (12 under tree canopy and 12 outside tree canopy) were collected from the 0.0-0.3m soil layer. The soil samples were analysed for texture (sand, silt, and clay content), moisture content, pH, organic matter, total nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), and manganese (Mn). The evolution of the pasture was recorded in the 24 sampling points at five monitoring dates: at the end of autumn (December 2015), at the end of winter (March 2016), and then monthly during spring 2016 (April, May, and June). The following pasture parameters were measured: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), capacitance, temperature, green and dry matter, ash, crude protein (CP), and neutral detergent fibre. Soil under tree canopy had significantly higher levels of organic matter, N, P, K, and Mg, and better pasture quality while the pasture productivity was higher outside tree canopy. The correlation between pasture direct measurements and sensor parameters was more consistent between capacitance and pasture productivity and between NDVI and CP. The use of fast and efficient tools associated with geo-referenced systems can greatly simplify the pasture monitoring process, which is the basis for estimating feed availability in the field. The knowledge of biomass quality and quantity is fundamental to support decision-making regarding animal stocking rates and rotation among grazing parcels."	39	14	81-87		Portugal		38.3	-8.01	Sheep		Dehesa/Montado		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Negative	Soil organic carbon		Positive					Seddaiu2018_329	Journal Article	2018	"Seddaiu, Giovanna; Bagella, Simonetta; Pulina, Antonio; Cappai, Chiara; Salis, Lorenzo; Rossetti, Ivo; Lai, Roberto; Roggero, Pier Paolo"	"Mediterranean cork oak wooded grasslands: synergies and trade-offs between plant diversity, pasture production and soil carbon"	Agroforestry Systems	0167-4366	10.1007/s10457-018-0225-7	<Go to ISI>://WOS:000440076000007	"Mediterranean wooded grasslands that emerge from silvopastoral activities are multifunctional systems that result in high biodiversity and offer ecosystem services such as forage production and soil carbon sequestration.

The objective was to identify optimum combinations of tree belts and pasture for sustainable livestock production and the prevention of secondary salinisation. Treatments were annual pasture, in competition with trees at different orientations (east, west and south), kikuyu pasture in competition with trees at one orientation (west), compared with pasture in the absence of tree competition. Plots had 0, 20 or 36% of their area within 10 m of the tree belt where tree-pasture competition would be expected. Plots (0.48 ha) were stocked with Merino wether hoggets at 12 DSE/ha on annual pastures and 14 DSE/ha on kikuyu pastures. Additional sheep were placed on plots in spring and the annual pasture was destocked in autumn. Within the growing season, herbage mass was similar across both control treatments as a result of varying stock numbers. However, in summer and autumn the kikuyu control contained between 350 and 4900 kg DM/ha more herbage than the corresponding annual pasture. While both pastures accumulated similar amounts of herbage in 1998 and 2000, kikuyu accumulated more in 1999 (11900 v. 9800 kg DM/ha) as a result of summer rain. Competition from tree belts significantly reduced adjacent annual pasture herbage accumulation (16% average reduction), although there was no difference among the levels of competition. Trees did not significantly affect adjacent kikuyu pasture herbage accumulation. Both carrying capacity and clean wool production per hectare were significantly higher on kikuyu pasture in 1999 and 2000. Tree competition also significantly reduced the carrying capacity of neighbouring annual and kikuyu pasture by an average of 10%. Clean wool production per hectare was significantly lower on annual pasture in combination with trees (11% reduction on average), but there was less effect of competition on kikuyu pasture. The kikuyu pasture used 115, 57 and 132 mm more water than the annual pasture in 1999, 2000 and 2001, respectively. The soil water deficit beneath the trees exceeded that below both control pastures by between 297 and 442 mm. Although the addition of tree belts to annual pasture provided substantial reductions in groundwater recharge, producers would also have to accept losses in livestock production.

Krasser) have been transformed into grasslands over the past few decades. In Chile's Aysen region, grazing in remnant forests is common practice but there is little empirical evidence of tree-understorey interactions therein. In an attempt to establish a scientific basis for silvopastoral implementation, the relationship between lenga cover and grassland productivity, quality and species richness was examined. Tree cover was quantified in 14 (20 x 20 m) sites where aboveground herbaceous biomass was evaluated monthly throughout two growing seasons. Herbage quality and plant species richness were measured once at the peak of biomass production in the second year. We discuss radiation transmitted through the canopy and water supply as drivers of the tree-understorey relationship. Changes in herbaceous species composition and richness with varying tree cover are described. Despite interannual differences, scattered trees or medium-density forests allow higher productivity than open areas, as well as an acceptable nutritive value and preservation of native species. Although further studies are required, our results suggest that presence of lenga trees within grazing areas can be an advantageous alternative in terms of biodiversity and productivity, to traditional grazing systems in open grasslands.

At each site, one transect of 80 m long (40 m in open grassland and 40 m in forest) x 10 m wide was established. ANPP was significantly higher in open grasslands but no gradual change in biomass production was observed from inside the forest towards the open grassland. In open grasslands ANPP was spatially uniform but highly variable between years of contrasting weather conditions, whereas in forests it was more spatially heterogeneous and less variable over time. ANPP was highly correlated with cattle consumption. Structural equation models developed for the whole system confirm that ANPP was driven mainly by photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and available nitrogen. However, we found important differences between forests and the adjacent open grasslands. In forests ANPP was enhanced by positive feedbacks between the amount of transmitted PAR through the canopy and soil nutrient input via cattle dung deposition. In open grasslands nitrogen availability appeared to be the main limiting factor but also influenced by weather conditions (dryer or wetter years). The coexistence of forests and grasslands patches, with different susceptibility of ANPP to meteorological and soil nutrient availability, highlights the importance of implementing an integrated silvopastoral system with lenga (Nothofagus pumilio [Poepp. & Endl.] Krasser) in northern Patagonia."	88	3	xviii-pp	agroforestry systems; biomass production; dry season; forests; grasslands; grazing; meteorological factors; net primary production; nitrogen; nutrient availability; photosynthesis; photosynthetically active radiation; silvopastoral systems; soil fertility; temperate zones; weather; wet season	Chile		-45.58	-72.08	Cattle		Forest grazing		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Negative								Salis2017_379	Journal Article	2017	"Salis, L.; Bagella, S.; Roggero, P.

Botanical composition and seasonal herbage production, pastoral value and pasture utilization rate, biodiversity indicators (Shannon index and plant species richness), and the content of soil organic carbon (SOC) were assessed. In spring, dry matter (DM) yield and legume content were higher in the OT than in BT. In autumn and winter no differences were observed between OT and BT areas in terms of DM production. In winter, legume abundance and animal utilization rate were higher in OT than BT.

Annual pasture production under Pseudotsuga menziesii and Pinus pinaster decreased progressively starting from 952 trees ha(-1), while decline in herbage production under Pinus radiata began to occur at 427 trees ha(-1). Tree density effect on pasture production was detected at 2,000 trees ha(-1) for all of the deciduous species studied. This effect on pasture production was more important in the first six months of the year (June sampling), while from June to December herbage production was less affected by tree density. The tree effect became more noticeable over time, with the last sampling showing the inverse relationship between tree density and herbage production most clearly. Seven years after tree establishment, pasture production was quite consistent under tree densities between 190 trees ha(-1) and 556 trees ha(-1) and declined remarkably from 556 trees ha(-1) to 2,500 trees ha(-1). The study also indicated that by the sixth growing season, annual pasture production under different tree species is inversely correlated with tree leaf area index."	70	1	1030-1033		Spain		42.22	-8.29	Pasture without livestock		Silvopasture		Other	Different densities of trees	Understory/pasture production		Decrease with increased tree density/cover/proximity								Rozados-Lorenzo2006_399	Journal Article	2006	"Rozados-Lorenzo, M.

A study was conducted to determine whether provision of shelter in the form of shrub belts (a 'maternity ward') could increase survival of twin lambs compared with hedgerows, and whether hedgerows improve survival of single lambs compared with unsheltered paddocks. Measurements were recorded for Merino x Poll Dorset cross twin lambs born in hedgerows (phalaris or hessian) or shrub belts and single lambs born in hedgerows or unsheltered paddocks over the years 2007-2009. Records for 382 single and 726 twin lambs were used. The survival of single lambs was not increased (P = 0.06) by hedgerow shelter. The survival of twin lambs in shrubs was 10% higher (P < 0.05) than that in hessian hedgerow shelter in 2008-2009 (0.77 cf. 0.70), associated with a reduction in deaths from starvation and/or mismothering and/or exposure. The hessian shelter was associated with an increased (P < 0.05) growth rate to weaning of single lambs, but the growth rates of twin lambs were lower (P < 0.05) in shrub than in hessian shelter. In 2010, a second study of 178 twin Merino x Poll Dorset cross lambs found that survival of lambs born alive was not improved by shrubs compared with unsheltered paddocks (0.80 versus 0.77; P > 0.05). It is concluded that shrub belts which forced twin-bearing ewes to lamb in a sheltered environment reduced perinatal mortality in one of three datasets, but was not repeated. The shrubs take time to establish, and the benefit will be small if weather is mild during lambing."	51	10	205-208		Australia	New South Wales	-35.12	147.31	Sheep		Hedge		Other	Pasture without trees OR hessian shelter	Livestock mortality		Mixed results (positive and no effect)								Ratliff1991_475	Journal Article	1991	"Ratliff, R.

Overstorey species affected standing crops differently on different range sites. On swales, standing crops were less under Q. wislizenii and P. sabiniana than in open areas. On open-rolling uplands, standing crops were less in the open and under Q. wislizenii than under Q. douglasii. On rocky-brush uplands, standing crops were less under all other overstorey species than under Q. douglasii.

At each site four tree stocking rates were studied (0, 500, 800, and 1700 stems ha(-1)). The trees were nine years old at the time of the study. Soil samples from each study site were taken once at three depths (0 to 75 mm, 75 to 150 mm, and 150 to 300 mm), with three replicates per tree stocking rate. Soil analyses showed that although there were differences between soil types, few statistically significant differences occurred due to tree stocking rate. A greenhouse pot trial growing ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L. cv. 'Concord') in soil from the 'A' horizon of each soil type from under the trees and the open pasture found that ryegrass yield, N uptake and N supply increased with increasing tree stocking rate. Increased N supply under the trees, coupled with greater soil moisture compared to the open pasture may have accounted for the higher pasture yield under Acacia melanoxylon compared to non dinitrogen fixing tree species.

Cocksfoot and lucerne productivity in a Pinus radiata silvopastoral system: a grazed comparison	Proceedings of the New Zealand Grassland Association	0369-3902			"Plant and animal production from cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata) pasture and lucerne (Medicago sativa) under 10-11 year-old radiata pine trees (Pinus radiata) (200 stems/ha) and from adjacent open pastures (without trees) were measured from the Lincoln University Silvopastoral Experiment, Canterbury, New Zealand. Light intensity under trees was 50-60% of the open pasture. Liveweight gain (LWG) from lucerne was 220 g/hd per day in the open and 158 g/hd per day under trees. On cocksfoot, LWG was 132 g/hd per day in the open and 100 g/hd per day under trees. When converted to LWG/ha, lamb production from open pastures was double that from shaded pastures for lucerne (5.1 and 2.5 kg/ha per day) and cocksfoot (3.4 and 1.7 kg/ha per day). Lucerne produced 11.2 t DM/ha in the open and 7.9 t DM per ha under trees which was 58 and 76% more than cocksfoot in the open and under trees, respectively. However, from September to November, when soil moisture was non-limiting, the lucerne DM production was 36% lower under tree shade than in the open. In comparison, the reduction was only 20% for cocksfoot, which confirms its greater 'shade tolerance'.

Cocksfoot and lucerne productivity in a Pinus radiata silvopastoral system: a grazed comparison	Proceedings of the New Zealand Grassland Association	0369-3902			"Plant and animal production from cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata) pasture and lucerne (Medicago sativa) under 10-11 year-old radiata pine trees (Pinus radiata) (200 stems/ha) and from adjacent open pastures (without trees) were measured from the Lincoln University Silvopastoral Experiment, Canterbury, New Zealand. Light intensity under trees was 50-60% of the open pasture. Liveweight gain (LWG) from lucerne was 220 g/hd per day in the open and 158 g/hd per day under trees. On cocksfoot, LWG was 132 g/hd per day in the open and 100 g/hd per day under trees. When converted to LWG/ha, lamb production from open pastures was double that from shaded pastures for lucerne (5.1 and 2.5 kg/ha per day) and cocksfoot (3.4 and 1.7 kg/ha per day). Lucerne produced 11.2 t DM/ha in the open and 7.9 t DM per ha under trees which was 58 and 76% more than cocksfoot in the open and under trees, respectively. However, from September to November, when soil moisture was non-limiting, the lucerne DM production was 36% lower under tree shade than in the open. In comparison, the reduction was only 20% for cocksfoot, which confirms its greater 'shade tolerance'. The reduced lamb LWG produced from lambs on shaded pastures was attributed to the reduced pre-grazing pasture mass and pasture bulk density, leading to reduced apparent intakes. Crude protein and digestibility values were not influenced by shade, and clover content in cocksfoot pastures were low (<7%).

Therefore, the aim of this study was to quantify the dry matter (DM) production, sward morphology, crude protein (CP%), organic matter digestibility (OMD) and macro-nutrient concentrations (P, K, Mg, Ca and S) in a grazed cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata L.) pasture under 10-year-old Pinus radiata D. Don forest. Four levels of light intensity were compared: full sunlight (100% photosynthetic photon flux density-PPFD), open + wooden slats (similar to 43% PPFD), trees (similar to 58% PPFD) and tree + slats (similar to 24% PPFD). The mean total DM production was 8.2 t DM ha(-1) yr(-1) in the open and 3.8 t DM ha(-1) yr(-1) in the trees + slats treatment. The changes in cocksfoot leaf area index (LAI) were related to variations in morphological aspects of the sward such as canopy height and tiller population. CP% increased as PPFD declined with mean values of 18.6% in open and 22.5% in the trees + slats treatment. In contrast, the intensity of fluctuating shade had little effect on OMD with a mean value of 79 +/- 3.2%. The mean annual macro-nutrient concentrations in leaves increased as the PPFD level declined mainly between the open and the trees + slats treatments. It therefore appears that heavily shaded dominant temperate pastures in silvopastoral systems limit animal production per hectare through lower DM production rates and per animal through reduced pre-grazing pasture mass of lower bulk density from the etiolated pasture."	70	1	167-171		New Zealand		-40.900557	174.885971	Pasture without livestock		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Negative								Pent2019_602i	Journal Article	2019	"Pent, Gabriel J.; Fike, John H."

In a 17-year-old Pinus pinaster Aiton plantation, established at a density of 1200 trees ha-1 in a semi-arid mediterranean environment of Macedonia, Greece, three degrees of thinning (control, 50% and 75% of trees removed), two levels of fertilisation (control and 1000 kg ha-1 of NPK fertiliser), and two grazing intensities (control and 0.8 sheep ha-1 year-1) were applied. All stands were seeded with 30 kg ha-1 of Dactylis glomerata L. seed. Measurements included cover and species composition, herbage production and nutrient content of the understory vegetation for three consecutive growing seasons. It was found that thinning and fertilisation significantly increased vegetative cover and herbage production by favouring the establishment of the seeded grass as well as other spontaneous species while a significant interaction also appeared between them. Grazing, however, significantly reduced understory vegetation. Applied nutrients were reduced by thinning and grazing while other nutrients such as Ca, Mg and Na were not affected by any treatment. It is concluded that thinning of dense P. pinaster stands up to 300 trees ha-1 and seeding palatable range grasses substantially improves grazing conditions for sheep. This improvement becomes impressive with NPK fertilisation, which increases herbage production and ameliorates its nutrient content even under fairly dense pine stands.

The effects of landscape heterogeneity on the diversity and productivity of herbaceous plant communities were studied in 29 plots of 1000 m(2), with a wide range of woody cover. A detrended correspondence analysis of the species x plots matrix explained 73% of the total variation and revealed the existence of two trends of variation in floristic composition: one associated with physiographic position (hillsides and flatlands) and the other related to the number of years since the last cutting, or coppicing, of A. caven. Despite the great majority of the original herbaceous species having disappeared as a result of the prevailing land use system, some native species have been able to survive especially on hillside areas with low grazing intensity. Woody cover was a good indicator of spatial heterogeneity and land use history. It was also correlated with stocking rate, above-ground biomass of herbaceous vegetation, and soil fertility (organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus concentration), both on hillsides and flatlands. The relationship between woody cover and herbaceous plant species richness was significant and unimodal in flat land areas, and linear, and marginally significant, on hillsides.

Unfortunately, little quantitative data exist regarding forage performance and economic outcomes associated with different forest-to-agriculture conversion strategies, particularly for the northern tier of states. This research examined forage dry matter production and quality in six forage treatments (orchardgrass, bluegrass, brome, and perennial ryegrass bicultures with white clover; cut hay; and a control) in newly-established silvopastures and open pastures converted from an early successional northern hardwood forest in New York. In addition, we conducted a financial analysis of the establishment of both agricultural systems, as well as a thinned forest treatment managed solely for wood products. Total forage dry matter production (planted forages plus volunteer grasses) was greater in open pastures than silvopastures in the first year after establishment; however, no differences in total forage production were found between silvopastures and open pastures in June or August of the second year. Total forage dry matter production was greater in the orchardgrass-white clover biculture compared to the control treatment in both years. Orchardgrass percent crude protein was lower in open pastures (10.7%) compared to silvopastures (12.9%) in June of year two. The financial analysis indicated that silvopasture outperformed open pasture and thinned forest treatments in terms of both IRR and NPV. We conclude that forage production in silvopastures can be competitive with that in open pastures on sites with a similar, forested, starting condition."	93	1	37-43		USA	New York	44.35	-73.53	Cattle		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		No effect								PositiveOosterbaan2006_693	Journal Article	2006	"Oosterbaan, A.; Schepers, H.; Kwanten, E."

The cultivars that performed best in these trials originated from British Columbia ('Broadview') and The Netherlands ('Buccaneer'). In an agroforestry project in the East, 8 farms planted 10 ha of walnut ('Broadview', 'Buccaneer'), cherry and sweet chestnut at a spacing between 10-20 metres. The initial investment for trees, poles, wire netting to protect against animals, resulted in a low net income for the first 5 years. Thereafter, the income from the combination of walnut and quality timber with grass is reasonable and may exceed the income from subsidised, extensively managed grass. The grass production varied from 3 to 9 tons of dry matter per hectare per year. In the 4 years of investigation there was no visible evidence that the presence of the trees had influenced the composition and production of the grass vegetation. Based on predicted crown development grass production will be possible for a long period. So far, the nut production from the young plantations has not been profitable. In order to find walnuts that were better adapted to the cooler weather conditions of the North, walnuts were selected from green areas in the North and evaluated for their characteristics. This resulted in at least two cultivars ('Dionym', 'Amphyon') with excellent yield potentials together with a good external and internal quality. Both cultivars have a low susceptibility to disease and are particularly suitable for organic cultivation. 'Dionym' and 'Amphyon' are planted in private gardens but also in a commercial organic orchard of 1.5 ha in which the 200 walnut trees are grown together (mixed cropping) with hazelnuts and Sea Buckthorn."		705	438	agroforestry; dry matter; grasslands; hazelnuts; organic farming; sown grasslands; walnuts	Netherlands		52.132633	5.291266	Unclear		Silvopasture		Baseline from implementation		Understory/pasture production		No effect								Mixed results (positive and no effect)Olson2000_696	Journal Article	2000	"Olson, B.

Changes in backfat thickness indicated that cattle in Winter 1 were catabolizing more lean muscle tissue, whereas cattle in Winter 2 were catabolizing more fat. Cattle entered Winter 1 in lower body condition and mass than in Winter 2. Cattle with access to windbreaks tended to have a stronger cell-mediated immune response than non-windbreak cattle.

Although alternative tools to increase forage availability during critical seasons exists, most of them are unaffordable and short-lived in marginal areas. We explore the potential benefits of deciduous tree plantations favoring winter forage productivity by comparing aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) patterns in herbaceous understory to tree plantations and natural grasslands in the Pampas (Argentina). These temperate subhumid grasslands are characterized by the coexistence of winter species, mainly C3 grasses of the native genera Stipa, Piptochaetium, and Bromus and the exotic genera Lolium and Festuca) and summer species (mainly C4 grasses of the native genera Paspalum, Bothriochloa, and Stenotaphrum) that replace each other throughout the seasons, with domination of the latter. We hypothesize that the natural decoupling of growing seasons between winter deciduous trees and winter grasses could provide the basis for the sustainable promotion of winter forage. We measured ANPP on two 23-year-old Populus deltoides plantations and their understory and compared them with adjacent open grasslands. Afforested stands had 55-75% higher annual ANPP than their non-afforested neighbors, with trees contributing similar to 70% to total ANPP. Herbaceous canopies beneath plantations achieved about half of the ANPP observed in non-afforested situations with a contrasting seasonal distribution associated with shifts from C4 to C3 grass dominance. Winter ANPP, the most critical source of forage in these grazing systems, was similar or higher in the herbaceous understory of tree plantations to that on their non-afforested counterparts, suggesting that mixed systems involving deciduous trees and understory pastures are a valid and viable option in the region."	83	2	84-107		Argentina		-36.09	-57.8	Cattle		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Mixed results (negative and no effect)								Neel2008_759	Journal Article	2008	"Neel, J.

Tree plantation is recognized as a way to reduce nutrient leaching and increase land profitability in agronomic and forest soils, meanwhile pasture fertilization and sowing is usually associated to better pasture productivity and quality. Fertilization can be performed with mineral fertilizers, which have become expensive in recent times, or with organic fertilizers like sludge, which is being promoted worldwide. This study aims to evaluate the effects of sludge fertilization, tree planting and pasture sowing on different variables of soil (KCl-pH, cation exchange capacity, total N, total and Mehlich P, nitrate and soil organic matter) and pasture (production, botanical composition, crude protein and P concentration) in treeless and agroforestry systems established in forest and agronomic soils. The experimental design was a randomized block following an incomplete factorial design with three replicates and nine treatments including two types of soils (forestry and agronomic), two types of vegetation (natural and sown), two types of fertilization (sludge fertilization and mineral fertilization, with a no fertilizer control) in afforested and treeless pastures. Pasture production and quality was better under agronomic soils, which also had higher levels of KCl-pH, cation exchange capacity, nitrate, total N and P than forest soils. Tree establishment did not modify nitrate or P leaching, probably due to the youth of the trees when most of nitrate was leached at the beginning of the experiment, but reduction of soil KCl pH and pasture crude protein was found in forest soils, when trees and pasture were together established, probably due to the high extractions of these systems compared with unsown forests. Moreover, the sludge inputs increased pasture production better than the mineral fertilizer in the forest soils, probably due to the greater amount of nutrients applied by the former. Sowing enhanced the presence of sown grasses in the forest understory, but their presence reduced pasture quality, and they disappeared within a short period of time. Therefore, the use of the sludge as fertilizer allows nutrient recycling of this residue in soils of low fertility and increases productivity and preserves fertility compared with mineral fertilizer at short (forest soils) and medium (agronomic soils) term."	139	4	421-434	afforestation; agricultural soils; agroforestry systems; cation exchange capacity; crude protein; cycling; farming systems; fertilizers; forest plantations; forest soils; grassland soils; grasslands; nitrate; nitrogen; organic fertilizers; pastoralism; pastures; phosphorus; pines; potassium chloride; productivity; protein content; silvopastoral systems; sludges; soil fertility; soil organic matter; soil pH; soil properties; sown grasslands; species composition; trees; woody plants	Spain	Galicia	42.5	-8.1	Pasture without trees		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		No effect	Soil organic matter		No effect		No effect			Morgan-Davies2008_813	Journal Article	2008	"Morgan-Davies, C.; Waterhouse, A.; Pollock, M.

Comparisons between initial bio-economical modelling results and actual monitored data over five years were made, to assess the potential success of such a combined system in terms of flock economics, local labour, woodland establishment and vegetation and bird impacts. Participative research to assess public benefits (including biodiversity) and uptake by the industry was also carried out. Results showed that with the exception of the slow rate of woodland establishment, results exceeded predictions, especially for the combined system economics, where actual returns were 20% more than predicted. The public and the industry were also very supportive of such an approach (78% and 68% of them respectively). It could also be argued that there is the potential to fully integrate the system in the future by grazing within the woodland and increased use for recreation and amenity, providing evidence that such a multiple land use approach is a viable one for upland and hill areas."	6	2	96-101		UK	Scotland	56.39	-3.44	Sheep		Farm woodland		Baseline from implementation		Livestock growth		Positive								PositiveMoreno2005_817	Journal Article	2005	"Moreno, G.; Obrador, J.; Garcia, E.; Cubera, E.; Montero, M.

Dense Callitris glaucophylla ( Joy Thomps. & L. A. S. Johnson) stands affect landscapes across NW NSW, Australia, and strategies to reduce tree density to levels which maintain biodiversity values alongside agricultural production are currently being sought. We investigated soil chemical and groundcover patterns associated with individual small and large C. glaucophylla trees at six sites of variable management history and lithology in NWNSW, Australia. We posed two questions: ( 1) do individual C. glaucophylla trees impose patterns on soil and groundcover ( soil extractable P, C, N, Sand pH, litter biomass, litter P and pasture cover), and, ( 2) if patterns exist, do they differ between tree sizes? Results showed that extractable P, C and pH decreased away from trees of both sizes, but significantly higher values were recorded adjacent to the stem of large trees. Litter biomass exhibited a strong site-related trend independent of soil variables. Positive correlations between litter and soil variables existed for some sites and not others, indicative of processes such as grazing which contribute to the transport of litter away from the tree. Irrespective of tree size ground-storey vegetation cover increased significantly away from the stem, presumably as a consequence of competition for soil water. Further results indicated that single C. glaucophylla trees enrich soils in patterns analogous to other species in similar environments worldwide. However, localised soil improvements must be weighed up against the negative effects of decreased groundcover associated with trees, and the potential for the species to re-seed prolifically into managed paddocks. Future research will discern the impact of individual C. glaucophylla trees at higher densities, where soil patterning may be modified by intense within-stand competition."	31	3	93-100		Australia	New South Wales	-30.05	142.66	Mixture of sheep and cattle		Wood pasture		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Decrease with increased tree density/cover/proximity	Total soil carbon		Positive					McCreary2001_919i	Journal Article	2001	"McCreary, D."

Factors consisted of cattle being fed in facilities with or without wind barriers and with or without shade. Steers were fed dry-relied corn-based diets (1.43 Mcal/ kg, NEg). Mean starting date and days on feed were June 26 and 79, respectively. I;I unshaded areas, temperature and humidity averaged 21.6 degrees C and 77.9%, and the blackglobe-humidity index (BGHI) at 1500 averaged between 84.0 and 89.1. Each of four 6.1- x 6.1-m structures (mean height = 3.4 m) with white steel roofs provided shade (2.65 m(2)/steer) for two pens. In facilities with wind barriers provided, airflow was reduced from the north and northwest by a 25-m-wide shelterbelt containing six rows of trees. For cattle fed in pens with wind barriers, shade increased(P < .05) gain from 0 to 56 d and decreased (P < .05) DMI/ADG from 0 to 28 d. Differences (P < .05) in performance were not found between shaded and unshaded cattle in any portion of the feeding period for cattle fed in the pens without wind barriers and over the entire feeding period in either type of facility. The shade response in pens with wind barriers seemed to be greater the Ist yr than in subsequent years. Differences in weather patterns among years, especially air temperature, humidity, and solar radiation, may partially explain this interaction. Also, in yr I, cattle tended to have greater fat thickness at finish than in yr 2 and 3. Correlations between BGHI and DMI tended to be greater during the early portion of the trial(0 to 28 d) than over the entire trial. Correlations between the difference in BGHI under shade vs no shade and percentage of shade use had the greatest magnitude and were significant only in the first 28 d vs over the entire feeding period. Although no heat-related cattle deaths occurred in this study, results suggest that shade improves cattle performance in the summer when they are fed in facilities with winter wind protection available and have not become acclimated to hot conditions. Once cattle are acclimated or hot conditions subside, compensation by unshaded cattle offsets much of the initial benefits of providing shade."	77	8	71-79		USA	Midwestern USA	42.48	-93.8	Cattle		Shelterbelt/Windbreak		Pasture without trees		Livestock mortality		Positive								Mader1997_1001	Journal Article	1997	"Mader, T.

In trials conducted over a 3-yr period with predominantly British and British x Continental crossbred yearlings, performance improvements due to providing shelter or wind protection in the winter were not detected; however, in the summer, providing wind protection or shelter resulted in decreased (P <.10) cattle gains. Cattle fed in the unprotected area had greater (P <.05) fat thickness in the winter and greater marbling scores in the winter (P <.05) and autumn(P <.10) than cattle fed in protected areas. When averaged across facilities, seasonal effects were detected for DMI (autumn >summer >winter > spring; P <.05). Feed:gain ratios followed a similar trend among seasons (summer and autumn >winter >spring P <.05). As a percentage of BW, winter (2.21), spring (2.19), and summer (2.18) DMI were less (P <.05) than autumn (2.35) DMI.

In unprotected, unsheltered pens, the greatest airflow tends to be at the highest point in the pen (bunks and mounds). In Nebraska, benefits realized from feeding cattle in sheltered or protected areas under average or slightly milder than average winter weather conditions may be offset by lower performance experienced by cattle fed in those same areas in the summer.

Cows were equipped with global positioning collars that recorded position, temperature and head movements at 5-min intervals during 6 days in each of four seasons repeated during 2 years. The time animals took to traverse areas of varying diameter revealed patches of 6-9-m diameter in the pastures with low, and 18-21-m diameter in the pastures with high tree canopy cover. In agreement with the current model, crookedness of cow paths had two distinct domains. Within distances of 0-40 m, paths were relatively straight and similar, but from 40 to 200 m, they became increasingly tortuous. Correlation of sequential turning angles identified patches of movement with diameters between 40 and 100 m, which correspond to the 'patch' level of grazing within grazing sites. Seasonal changes in meal patterns were consistent with changes in temperature and forage quality and interacted with the distribution of shade. Thus, spatial distribution of grazing and temporal distribution of meals were inextricably linked. Low forage quality and high temperatures in summer resulted in highly concentrated grazing around trees. Conversely, winter and early spring forages of very high quality and low availability motivated more widely distributed grazing, with low proportion of areas being re-grazed. Resting sites acted as beginning and end of grazing bouts. We conclude that shade distribution can modulate meal start and duration."	55	3	933-960		USA	California	39.16	-121.56	Cattle		Wood pasture		Pasture without trees		Livestock growth		Positive								LaRade2011_1129	Journal Article	2011	"LaRade, Shawna E.; Bork, Edward W."

Inter-tree spacing remained above the postulated minimum of 60-80 cm, indicating that livestock can access the stand. Timber harvesting increased forage production by 69%, while grazing had no effect on forage production. Soil penetration resistance was similar for three harvesting treatments down to a 21-cm depth, while between 21 and 60 cm penetration resistance was consistently the highest on summer-harvested plots, followed by winter-harvested and unharvested plots. Grazing had no impact on soil penetration resistance.

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of clearcut harvesting and long-term cattle grazing on plant species diversity and soil quality in aspen cutblocks located about 5 km south of Dawson Creek in the Peace River region of BC. The site was winter harvested from November 1988 to March 1989. Cattle grazing was done for one month per year (early June to early July) to achieve 75% utilization of forage vegetation. The experiment was laid out as a split-plot randomized complete block design with three replications and four transects per plot. Sample collection and vegetation assessments were completed during the summer 2001. Timber harvesting of these aspen stands increased the cover of plant species such as bluejoint reedgrass (Calamagrostis canadensis), northern bedstraw (Galium boreale), tall bluebells (Mertensia paniculata), and sweet coltsfoot (Petasites frigidus) probably as a result of greater light transmission. The cover of young aspen was increased by timber harvesting by over 15 times, while the cover of young balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera) increased by over 200 times. Ten years of cattle grazing did not significantly affect the canopy cover of aspen, but increased the total number of plant species relative to the ungrazed treatments because of enhanced colonization of endemic species. The measured soil properties were not significantly affected by either the timber harvest or the long-term cattle grazing. Soil penetration resistance showed that harvesting and cattle grazing did not result in soil compaction.

Lodgepole pine nutrition and growth on grazed forest cutblocks in southern British Columbia	BC Journal of Ecosystems and Management	1488-4666			"Forest grazing occurs on replanted or naturally regenerated cutblocks, giving temporary grazing opportunities for British Columbia's (Canada) beef industry. However, grazing on forest cutblocks sometimes results in conflicts between the different interests of the timber and ranching industries. The forester's primary concern about cattle grazing and forage seeding on cutblocks is tree damage by trampling and browsing, followed by soil compaction and altered tree nutrition. This study evaluated the effect of long-term cattle grazing and forage seeding on growth and nutrition of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) on three grazed forest cutblocks near Kamloops and Merritt, British Columbia, Canada. Grazing regimes consisted of ungrazed exclosures and pastures grazed at 50% forage utilization during 1989-1998. Forage seeding treatments were 0 and 12 kg/ha. Tree measurements and foliage samples were obtained in September 1999. Tree height, current-year growth (length of leader internode), and foliar nutrient levels of regenerating lodgepole pine have not been significantly affected by forage seeding rate and 9 years of cattle grazing. The absence of significant effects on tree growth and nutrition is particularly noteworthy because of the marginal or somewhat deficient status of several nutrients (N, P, B, Fe, and Cu) on these study sites. The management implications of this study relate to the benign effects of 9 years of cattle grazing on lodgepole pine nutrition and growth. The study provides evidence that cattle grazing is compatible with forestry. These results support the integrated use of forested rangelands in southern British Columbia. Attempting to extrapolate these findings to other site conditions should be done with caution."	1	2	477-485	cattle farming; grazing; growth; pines; plant height; plant nutrition; trees; woody plants	Canada	British Columbia	50.61	-120.85	Cattle		Silvopasture		Forest without grazing		Total productivity (pasture + trees)		Positive								Koukoura2007_1180	Journal Article	2007	"Koukoura, Z.; Kyriazopoulos, A."

One savanna and one pasture were paired on loam soils, the other sites were on sandy soils. In general, soil moisture was higher below tree canopies than outside canopies during a drying trend and was similar between areas after a period of rain. Soil organic matter and potassium (K) decreased with increasing distance from tree boles on all sites, while phosphorus (P) showed a similar trend only on the pastures. Pastures had greater soil organic matter and P than savannas of similar soil texture, while the loam soil sites had higher soil pH, organic matter, K, Ca and Mg than sandy sites of similar disturbance history. Areas below canopies received 67% of the ambient rainfall and 27-48% of the ambient photosynthetically active radiation and had 2.3-5.2 C lower soil temperatures compared to areas outside the canopies. Although soil moisture, nutrient and organic matter levels seemed more favorable for plant growth under the canopies, aboveground biomass was lower below canopies compared to open areas at the two savannas, while biomass was equal between canopy and open areas on the one pasture that was measured. This indicates that other factors, such as light, were more important in determining plant biomass. For all sites, plant composition under tree canopies differed from that outside the canopies. Savanna plant species were predominantly perennial and native while pasture species were mostly perennial and exotic. Grazing, fire and previous introductions of prairie species may have been major factors in determining the prevalent species (>5% cover) for a given site. Poa spp. were more prevalent below canopies compared to open areas on all sites, despite their different disturbance histories."	130	1	277-297		USA	Wisconsin	43.06	-89.44	Cattle		Wood pasture		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Negative	Soil organic matter		Positive					Knowles1992_1198i	Journal Article	1992	"Knowles, R.

Results of two studies of the prescriptive application of selective grazing designed to suppress growth of a common understory shrub, deerbrush (Ceanothus integerrimus Hook. & Am.), to favor growth of conifer species are presented. Grazing for vegetation manipulation requires the same information needed to apply any chemical or mechanical method: knowledge of the effective timing, frequency, and intensity of application, and the selectivity of impact. The first study, a two-year series of grazing trials, examined the degree of cattle preference for deerbrush as compared to conifers, and response of deerbrush to grazing on a forest site. The second, a three-year study based on grazing trial results, used clipping to examine the specifics of deerbrush response to patterns of herbivory. Deerbrush was highly preferred by cattle in the grazing trials. Even at 90% utilization of the shrubs, no conifers were browsed. High degrees of utilization did not suppress shrub growth in the grazing trials. The clipping study found deerbrush significantly responsive to frequency and intensity of defoliation (P < 0.01), but not to season of use (P > 0.1). High intensity, frequent grazing is required to suppress the shrub. Intermediate prescriptions can be used to manage for various combinations of wildlife, timber, or forage-related objectives. These results and methods are applicable to any silvopastoral system where prescriptive grazing is used in conjunction with tree crops."	34	1	179-186		USA	California	38.31	-119.66	Cattle		Silvopasture		Forest without grazing		Understory/pasture production		Positive								Holechek1981_1342	Journal Article	1981	"Holechek, J.

A 15% increase in pasture production was recorded at 0.7 tree height distance on both sides of the shelterbelts. There was also a gradual trend of increasing dry matter production as distance from the shelterbelts increased.

To date, their economic benefits have not been assessed, partly because of the difficulty in evaluating the many interrelated pasture, soil, animal and forestry factors. Recent shelterbelt research in New Zealand has been conducted as a collaborative approach by AgResearch, Forest Research and Hort Research. Results of pasture, soil and tree measurements in the East Coast region indicate that shelterbelts, however managed, do not significantly increase pasture production in the sheltered zone. The competitive effects of trees reduce soil moisture in zones close to the shelter, which also encourages the accumulation of dung and urine nutrients in this zone by animals seeking protection. The modification in resting patterns as a result of shelter may be reflected in improved animal welfare and production but this was not measured. The value of timber from shelterbelts on the East Coast indicates that they have a role in diversifying farming income and offering a modified land use, which will help to sustain productive farming practices."	61		143-152	agroforestry systems; animal welfare; economic evaluation; farming systems; grassland management; grasslands; income; land use; livestock farming; nutrients; pastures; shelter; shelterbelts; silvopastoral systems; soil fertility; soil water content	New Zealand		-39.76	176.7	Mixture of sheep and cattle		Shelterbelt/Windbreak		Baseline from implementation		Total productivity (pasture + trees)		Mixed results (positive and negative)								PositiveHawke1991_1400	Journal Article	1991	"Hawke, M.

P. radiata is grown across a wide range of sites in New Zealand and under several management regimes. For agroforestry, P. radiata is usually grown under a direct sawlog regime with final tree stockings of around 200 stems/ha. Lower tree stockings allow pasture production well into the rotation (tree age 15) to the extent that at 100 stems/ha, pasture growth is 32% that of open pasture (no trees). Pasture growth declines with increasing tree stocking and age. Pasture botanical composition changes from high producing temperature pasture species to low fertility grasses and legumes. Under closely spaced pines, high levels of accumulated decaying needles smother the remaining pasture. Sheep performance generally declines with time in a totally planted agroforestry site. Feed quality (in vitro digestibility) of pasture decreases with increasing tree stocking. Factors affecting livestock performance in temperate agroforestry include class and species of stock, livestock shelter, pasture management, gastrointestinal parasite populations and ingestion of decaying pine needles. The significance of these factors and the benefits of agroforestry to the New Zealand scene are discussed.

Two systems: (1) widely spaced, planted poplar for soil conservation, and (2) non-eroded open pasture were compared to determine the relative effect of the poplar-pasture system on the production, nutritive value and species composition of the pasture, and on the water balance. Measurements were made at three sites with mature poplar (> 29 years and 37-40 stems ha(-1)) and at a replicated experiment with young poplar (5 years, 50-100 stems ha(-1)). Soil water relations did not suggest strong competition for water between poplar and pasture. Pasture accumulation under mature poplar was 40% less than in the open pasture, but under young poplar was similar to that in the open pasture. Chemical composition of pasture suggested that feed quality of pasture in the open was better than under the poplar canopy, except during spring, when most chemical components were similar. At the most, in vitro digestibility of pasture dry matter was 8.9% lower and metabolisable energy of pasture dry matter was 1.5 MJ kg lower under the poplar canopy than in the open pasture. Shade tolerant species were not dominant in the plant community under the poplar canopy with grasses such as browntop (Agrostis capillaris, L.) and ryegrass (Lolium perenne, L.) being a high proportion of the plant community. Differences in chemical composition were related to differences in the botanical composition between the open pasture and the poplar understorey. It was concluded that the greatest effect of poplar was on pasture production due to shading, and that management of this silvopastoral system needs to focus on control of the tree canopy to lessen the decrease in pasture production."	69	3	145-148		New Zealand		-40.09	175.89	Mixture of sheep and cattle		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Negative								Guevara-Escobar1997_1453	Journal Article	1997	"Guevara-Escobar, A.; Kemp, P.

Nonetheless, Wisconsin property tax law creates an incentive for this practice. Therefore, this project sought to determine the effects of cattle grazing on vegetation and soil conditions in woodlands under different grazing management. We compared eleven grazed woodlots under various livestock management regimes with five woodlots that have not been grazed for at least 30 years in the Kickapoo Watershed in Crawford County, WI. We conducted vegetation surveys in all the woodlands and measured soil properties in a subset. We talked to farmers about their cattle management practices and beliefs about farm woodlots. Grazed woodlands had higher frequencies of introduced shrubs, less litter depth, fewer seedlings and saplings, more grass cover, and higher soil bulk density compared with un-grazed woodlands. Grazing negatively impacted regeneration and condition of seedlings, saplings, and saplings of commercial value. In grazed woods, we noted a relation between the cattle stocking rate and edaphic variables including amount of bare soil, litter depth, and canopy cover, and a difference between dairy and beef cattle in shrub density. We validated a set of simple indicators and metrics for on-going comparison of grazed and un-grazed farm woodlots in this area.

Livestock also profit from the acorns, and the grazing contributes to avoid shrub encroachment. In the last 20 years, subsidies from the European Union have greatly promoted cattle rearing in this system and the introduction of heavy breeds, at the expense of sheep, goats or the native cattle breeds. The balance of the traditional system is thus threatened, and a precise assessment of the balance between the different components of the system, therefore is highly needed. The goal of this study was to gain a better understanding of a Montado farm system with cattle rearing as the major economic activity by applying the emergy evaluation method to calculate indices of yield, investment, environmental loading and sustainability. By integrating different ecosystem components, the emergy evaluation method allows a comprehensive evaluation of this complex and multifunctional system at the scale of an individual farm. This method provides a set of indices that can help us understand the system and design management strategies that maximize emergy flow in the farm. In this paper, we apply the emergy evaluation method to a Montado farm with cattle rearing, as a way to gain a better understanding of this system at the farm scale. The value for the transformity of veal (2.66E+06 sej J(-1)) is slightly higher, when compared to other systems producing protein. That means that the investment of nature and man in this product was higher and it requires a premium price on the market. The renewability for Holm Oaks Farm (49 %), lower than for other similar systems, supports the assumption that this is a farm in which, comparing with others, the number of purchased inputs in relation to renewable inputs provided by nature, is higher. The Emergy Investment Ratio is 0.91 for cattle rearing compared to a value of 0.49 for cork and 0.43 for firewood harvesting, making it clear that cattle rearing is a more labor demanding activity comparing with extractive activities as cork and firewood harvesting."	90	1	215-6		Portugal	Montemor-o-Novo	38.64	-8.2	Cattle		Dehesa/Montado		No comparator		Livestock growth		Positive								Ffolliott1989_1628	Journal Article	1989	"Ffolliott, P.

In most areas agriculture is limited to pasture although the native climax vegetation is a species-diverse forest. Silvopasture systems can help diversify and increase farm income. Information is needed on the yield response of forage grown as an understory crop among trees. The light environment of a conifer silvopasture was characterized by three methods, a hand-held photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) meter for quick measurements over a large area, fixed PAR meters recorded using data loggers for a large number of measurements over time, and hemispherical photography with software to calculate seasonal direct beam radiation. Light data were considered in terms of forage yield. Plots were harvested when forage reached 20-25 cm in height after which the entire area was grazed by sheep. There were limitations to all methods of quantifying radiation environment for predicting yield. Yield decreased linearly with decreased PAR; however, data variability was high and correlations, while statistically significant, were weak. Grazed silvopastures are dynamic with shifting yield patterns in response to the interactions between the spatially variable soil, changing seasonal environment, and spatially variable animal impacts for each grazing event."	65	3	179-188		USA	Virginia	37.79	-81.17	Sheep		Silvopasture		No comparator		Understory/pasture production		Negative								Feldhake2009_1661	Journal Article	2009	"Feldhake, C.

While some grazing in woodlots is common, a set of guidelines for optimal utilization of these areas is not. We thinned a white oak dominated mature second growth forested area establishing two 0.5 ha, eight-paddock, orchardgrass-perennial ryegrass-white clover silvopasture replications for comparison with two nearby open pasture replications. After thinning trees, silvopastures were limed, fertilized and seeded. Sheep were fed hay and corn scattered across the area to facilitate removal of residual understory and incorporation of applied materials into surface soil. We measured soil moisture in the top 15 cm using TDR and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) using a system of 16, 1 m line Quantum Sensors during the subsequent growing seasons of 2004, 2005, and 2006. Paddocks were rotationally grazed by sheep with two 1 m2 herbage mass samples taken prior to animal grazing. There was no significant difference in soil moisture between silvopastures and open pastures however, there was adequate rainfall to prevent drought all three years. The two silvopasture replications had residual tree stands of 14.1 and 15.6 m2 ha-1 diameter breast height allowing 42 and 51% of total daily incident PAR compared to measurements in the open field. Total forage mass yield from open pasture for 2004, 2005 and 2006 was 9.9, 10.5 and 10.2 t ha-1 respectively and for silvopasture 8.5, 6.7 and 6.7 t ha-1. Silvopastures received 47% of open pasture incident PAR yet yielded an average of 72% as much herbage mass as the open pastures. The silvopasture soils were managed for forage production only a few years unlike the open pastures which received roughly a century of better management. Soil limitations may have contributed to decreased forage yield in silvopastures in addition to reduced PAR."			154-162	agroforestry systems; biomass production; deciduous forests; drought; establishment; forests; grazing; photosynthesis; rain; silvopastoral systems; soil water content; thinning	USA	Virginia	37.79	-81.17	Sheep		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Positive								Feldhake2002_1663	Journal Article	2002	"Feldhake, C.

During these periods, air temperature is frequently adequate for forage growth to supply feed for grazing animals. The effect of thermal radiation from conifer tree canopies on forage canopy temperature was evaluated for a silvopasture with variable tree density. A long-wave radiation-sensitive sensor for measuring temperature at the forage canopy level was designed, tested, and used to approximate night time forage canopy temperature during the autumn of 1999 and 2000 and spring of 2000. Temperature from the designed sensor correlated linearly with forage canopy temperature measured with an infrared thermometer with a slope of 1.0, a 0.9 degreesC offset, and an r(2) of 0.999. The response of sensor temperature to night sky shading by trees was also linear. Under 77% tree cover sensor temperature remained within half a degree of air temperature, however, under 7% cover averaged 10.4 degreesC below air temperature during radiation frost events. The results of this study indicate that a well designed silvopasture can potentially extend the grazing season period on both ends in regions were radiation frosts are prevalent.

Silvopastures offer solutions to many management issues associated with grazing systems in Appalachia (USA). Several tree species have been proposed for silvopastures in humid temperate regions, but few data comparing animal performance from systems with different deciduous tree species are available. The objective of this project was to compare early-stage honeylocust (Gleditsia triacanthos)or black walnut (Juglans nigra)silvopastures with open pastures in terms of forage botanical composition, yield, and nutritive value, and in terms of gain, carcass characteristics, and meat quality of hair sheep (Ovis aries) that grazed these systems. Forage and animal performance from open systems (i.e., no trees) was compared with that from silvopastures containing 13- and 14-year-old honeylocust or black walnut trees. Cool-season grass-legume pastures were rotationally stocked with crossbred hair sheep from mid-June through September in 2008 and 2009. Forage production varied by year and pre-graze forage mass in black walnut silvopastures generally was less (P0.05) than in open pastures at most measurement periods. Averaged over the season, forage production in honeylocust silvopastures tended (P=0.0937) to be lower than in open systems in 2008 and was lower (P=0.0001) in 2009. Few differences in forage nutritive value among systems were observed. Total and average daily gains (ADG) did not differ among treatments in 2008, but black walnut silvopastures supported less (P0.05) ADG and total gain than open pastures and honeylocust silvopastures in 2009. Carcass characteristics evaluated did not vary among treatments although hot carcass weights were lower (P<0.05) for lambs that grazed black walnut silvopastures. Although walnut-based systems were less productive and will need modification to improve output, similar levels of performance between open pastures and honeylocust systems show the potential of silvopasture systems to supply multiple products from the land base without reducing agricultural system production."	93	1	199-219		USA	Virginia	37.22	-80.42	Sheep		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees		Livestock growth		Mixed results (positive and negative)								Duncan2009_1754	Journal Article	2009	"Duncan, David H.; Dorrough, Josh W."

We analysed historical, ecological and land use data to understand the threats to native vegetation, and prospects for future recovery in the wheat-sheep zone of the Wimmera and Mallee in southeastern Australia. We analysed air photos, surveyed 60 remnant vegetation sites, and interviewed land managers about a subset of 35 remnants. Our analysis confirmed that soil types favoured for cropping were largely cleared before 1945; mean cover declined from 8% to 5% between 1945 and 2000. Small patches (<5 ha) account for a quarter of remaining woody cover. Cover of crops increased at the expense of pasture. Small patches were typically frequently grazed, nutrient enriched and were dominated by an exotic annual understorey. Recruitment of woody species was uncommon, and non-existent in the small patches. Landholders valued small patches primarily for stock shelter but without recruitment their long-term persistence is doubtful, even though most farmers are grazing less now compared with 30 years ago. Meeting regional native vegetation cover targets likely depends on retention of all existing vegetation patches, plus considerable revegetation. However, although current land use trends allow the sparing of some marginal lands while cropping intensifies, this option cannot satisfy vegetation cover targets and may not preserve biodiversity. More significant gains in native vegetation cover may not occur unless new opportunities arise for the current cohort of farmers. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The resultant incomes have been compared with that from an equivalent unafforested area to assess the likely economic implications of intercropping trees with grass. At a discount rate of 5%, the indications are that combining wood and sheep meat production on the same area could be financially attractive. At higher discount rates, the economic attraction of growing trees is more dependent on an increase in timber prices relative to those prevailing at present. However, given the large number of assumptions necessitated by the limited availability of data and in the absence of any means of validating the model, extreme care is needed in interpreting the results.

Using the model, an assessment has been made of the implications of varying the density and the planting pattern of the trees on the combined income from the sale of wood and livestock over a number of years. The resultant incomes have been compared with that from an equivalent unafforested area to assess the likely economic implications of intercropping trees with grass. At a discount rate of 5%, the indications are that combining wood and sheep meat production on the same area could be financially attractive. At higher discount rates, the economic attraction of growing trees is more dependent on an increase in timber prices relative to those prevailing at present. However, given the large number of assumptions necessitated by the limited availability of data and in the absence of any means of validating the model, extreme care is needed in interpreting the results. Confident economic projections of the value of intercropping trees with grass await further experimental work on appropriate growth models for open-grown trees, light interception, tree rooting patterns and water uptake of tree roots."	21	1	65-68	Agroforestry; broadleaves; economics; Farm forestry; grasslands; intercropping; models; Silvopastoral systems; simulation; simulation models; trees; woody plants	UK		51.46	-0.97	Sheep		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees		Livestock growth	Multiple	Negative								Mixed results (positive and negative)Douglas2001_1778.1	Journal Article	2001	"Douglas, G.

The effect of widely spaced trees of Populus nigra x P. maximowiczii, aged 8-11 years, on the growth and botanical and chemical composition of understorey pasture mixes, and was determined over 3 years at a southern North Island hill country site. Pasture mixes comprised existing pasture, and two introduced test swards comprising new grass (Agrostis capillaris, Dactylis glomerata, Lolium perenne) and legume (Lotus uliginosus, Trifolium repens) cultivars. Pasture accumulation beneath trees (6.6 tonnes DM ha-1 year-1) was 23% less than open (unshaded, no trees) pasture (8.6 tonnes DM ha-1 year-1) and differences in accumulation occurred between tree aspects (North and South sides of trees) when trees were foliated. In early spring, North plots produced 11-14% more herbage than South plots whereas in late summer, South plots produced up to 44% more herbage than North plots. Yield of both test swards (6.4 and 8.0 tonnes DM ha-1 year-1) was not significantly different from that of the existing sward (7.4 tonnes DM ha-1 year-1) but productivity varied between swards in spring and summer. One test sward included Lotus uliginosus cv. Grasslands Maku, and the sward produced 30% more DM than the other swards in mid-summer. Dactylis glomerata cv. Grasslands Wana comprised 37% of the DM of swards in which it was sown and was the most successful cultivar, followed by Grasslands Maku.

The group included representation from landowners, government agencies and scientists. The group was facilitated through an action research approach incorporating three phases: (1) awareness; (2) forecasting; and (3) implementation. The group identified a set of goals and indicators relevant to achieving a ""well managed rural hill catchment"" The indicators were used to (a) assess the current state of the catchment farm in relation to the goals; (b) evaluate a range of strategies for improving system performance and (c) evaluate progress toward the goals following land use changes implemented within the catchment farm. Key issues for the group included the availability of data and the setting of appropriate performance benchmarks. From both economic and environmental points of view, the existing farm system was failing to meet the goals set by the management group. Key factors driving these outcomes included the physical and productivity limitations of the soil resource, poor livestock performance and poor water quality. A mixture of research observations, decision support models and expert stakeholder knowledge indicated scope for improving performance through forestry, riparian management, erosion control and livestock intensification options. Based on their evaluation of the forecasting results, the group developed a new land use plan, which depended on significant capital investment in land use and enterprise change. Subsequent monitoring of soils, vegetation, water quality, animal production and financial results over four years showed marked improvement in a number of key performance indicators. In particular, sediment and phosphorus loads and faecal coliform levels decreased rapidly, native forest fragments showed early signs of restoration, lamb and beef productivity increased and the per hectare financial returns of the pastoral component increased. Better matching of land use to land capability has led to short-term improvement in some aspects of the economic and environmental performance of the catchment farm. Progress toward a more sustainable agricultural system was achieved, but at a substantial cost for transformation of the biophysical system, which has implications for the wider sector.

This has been attributed to a combination of factors including improved water use efficiency by shaded grass and increased water availability through hydraulic lift by trees. The objectives of this research were to determine if silvopastures changed forage mass production and available soil water, and to determine how these two factors were related. Forage mass and soil water were sampled at 1.0, 2.0, and 3.6 m from the tree stem, or plot center under honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos L.), black walnut (Juglans nigra L.) and shade cloth in 2006 and 2007. Soil water was measured in the top 10 cm of soil using a capacitance probe, and at 30-cm intervals, from 45 to 105 cm, using a neutron probe. Forage was collected to determine dry mass and annual yield. In 2006, forage mass was greater under black walnuts and honey locusts than under 70% shade cloth. In 2007, with a 50% shade cloth, forage growth was similar in all treatments. In both 2006 and 2007, soil moisture in the top 10 cm was higher under shade cloth compared to honey locust or black walnut trees. Similarities in forage mass between treatments in 2007 indicate that the differences in soil water were not biologically significant for forage growth. Lower forage mass under the 70% shade cloth in 2006 was due to suppressed growth from intense shading. The major implication for pasture managers is that trees in these pastures had no negative effect on soil water availability and forage growth."	83	2	689-703		USA	Virginia 	37.19	-80.4	Pasture without livestock		Silvopasture		Baseline from implementation		Understory/pasture production		No effect				No effect				Currie1978_1888	Journal Article	1978	"Currie, P.

Silvopastoral production systems depend on forest species development and tree density established, but also on soil fertilization management practices, which may modify the tree-pasture relationship. Pinus radiata is broadly used in the Atlantic biogeographic region of Spain and it is a fast-growing species with a very dense canopy that could limit pasture production if planted at a high density. One of the main factors limiting pasture productivity on forestlands, especially at early plantation stages, is the low soil fertility, making it necessary to add products to overcome the acidity of the soils and the low nutrient availability. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between tree cover and pasture production in a Pinus radiata stand developed on a very acid soil. The results obtained showed a negative linear relationship between litterfall biomass and pasture production and positive relationship between litterfall biomass and tree height."	17		363-374		Spain		42.26	-8.34	Pasture without livestock		Silvopasture		Other	Different tree densities	Understory/pasture production		Decrease with increased tree density/cover/proximity								Cossens2000_1931.1	Journal Article	2000	"Cossens, G.

Our experimental scheme was developed to determine to which extent it is important to integrate perennial grasses and, for our environmental conditions, what are the species yielding better results under rotational and extensive systems of pasture exploitation. Near Elvas, Portugal, trials were established to compare biodiverse sown pastures (CMIX) with natural ones (NS). The results show that, in terms of biomass yield, it is possible to detect, on the first year of the trial, a small positive response corresponding to CMIX. On the second year, the results show an important increase of CMIX in relation to NS. A finer analysis of the benefits of the sowing state reveals that on the second year there were very important increases in legume and grass proportion in the biomass. The grasses introduced that had more persistence are Dactylis glomerata followed by Lolium perene and Phalaris aquatica. The other perennial grass introduced in the mixture, Festuca arundinacea, had great difficulties to persist."		79	2-pp	adaptation; biomass production; extensive farming; farming systems; fodder legumes; fodder plants; grassland improvement; grassland management; grasslands; legumes; pastures; rotations; sown grasslands	Portugal	Elvas	38.88	-7.17	Cattle		Silvopasture		Other	Biodiverse sown pastures vs. natural ones	Understory/pasture production		Positive								Carlson1994_2038	Journal Article	1994	"Carlson, D.

Treatments included all possible combinations of two tree-planting patterns (trees planted 2.4 m apart in a grid, and groups of five trees spaced 7.6 m between clusters) and two grazing/understory management systems (agroforests were seeded to subclover and grazed by sheep; forests were unseeded and ungrazed). Mean twig xylem water potential (XWP) for Douglas-fir trees ranged from -0.3 to -1.5 MPa on forest plots and from -0.3 to -1.2 MPa on agroforest sites. Pre-dawn and sunset XWP were more negative for forest than for agroforest plots during dry summer periods. Midday XWP was similar for both agroforest and forest plots on all dates. Soil water content at 50-100 cm depth was greater under agroforest plots as compared to forest plots in 1984, but not in 1985 (unusually dry spring). Average foliage nitrogen content of tree needles was 1.54% vs. 1.43% for agroforests vs. forests, respectively. Our data are consistent with the hypotheses that: (1) grazing of understory vegetation may reduce water stress of trees during dry periods by reducing transpirational water use by the forage plants; and (2) nitrogen-fixing vegetation combined with grazing increases nitrogen uptake of associated trees. However, neither mean foliar N nor average XWP differences experienced by trees in agroforest versus forest plantations were sufficient to have an effect on tree growth. Our data demonstrate that it is possible to produce a second crop (i.e. forage grazed by sheep) in timber plantations without reducing the growth of the main tree crop.

In 1995, black walnut (Juglans nigra L.) and honey locust (Gleditisia triacanthos L.) trees were planted within plots (r = 3) of predominantly tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) pasture. Trees were planted down slopes in rows to create low, medium, and high tree densities at shoulder-, mid-, and toe-slope positions. Sampling sites (n = 54) under field treatment combinations were harvested May to October at 35-d intervals in 2002 and 2003. Before spring, summer, and fall harvests, plots were subsampled for botanical composition. Tree species did not affect botanical composition when compared over the two seasons. Plots under honey locust trees tended to have more fescue in a dry year (2002) and more legumes and less dead herbage in a wet year (2003). Greater percentages of warm-season grasses and fewer weeds were observed at low tree density sites in 2003. Forage mass (5280,6130, and 4970 kg ha(-1) at low, medium, and high tree densities) was 16% greater under medium-density trees.

GHG emissions per kilogram meat in the economic optimum differ between the production systems and range from 18 to 21.9 kg CO2-eq./kg meat. Only GHG offset by agroforestry systems showed the potential to significantly reduce these emissions. Depending on the production system agroforestry systems could reduce net GHG emissions by 66% to 7.3 kg CO2-eq./kg meat in the most intensive system and by 100% in the most extensive system. In this calculation a carbon sequestration rate of 8 t CO2/ha/year was assumed. The potential of a combination of the addition of lipids to the diet, a cover of the slurry tank and the application of nitrification inhibitors only had the potential to reduce GHG emissions by 12% thereby marginal abatement costs are increasing much faster than for agroforestry systems. A reduction of the GHG emissions to 7.5 kg CO2-eq./kg meat-possible with agroforestry only-raised costs between 0.03 CHF/kg meat and 0.38 CHF/kg meat depending on the production system and the state of the system before the reduction.

Producers require dependable plant resources and management practices that improve the seasonal distribution and persistence of high quality herbage, sustainability and environmental integrity of the agricultural landscape. It was hypothesized that inorganic N and fecal coliform concentrations delivered in leachate to the soil/bedrock interface would be lowest in deciduous forest (HF) and highest in pasture (CP) with HF converted to silvopasture (SP) between the two. Piezometers were used to monitor water quality at the soil/bedrock interface under conventional pasture, SP, and hardwood forest. The pasture and SP were rotationally grazed by sheep during the spring to fall grazing season (2004-2008). Geometric mean fecal coliform bacteria concentrations (FC) were greatest in SP (18 FC 100 mL(-1)) with no difference between CP (7.5 FC 100 mL(-1)) and HF (5.6 FC 100 mL(-1)). Mean NO(3)-N concentration was lowest in SP (2.3 mg L(-1)) and greatest in CP (4.4 mg L(-1)) and HF (4.1 mg L(-1)), which were not significantly different. Mean NH(4)-N concentrations showed different trends with the lowest mean concentration in CP (0.5 mg L(-1)) and the greatest in SP (2.5 mg L(-1)) and HF (2.6 mg L(-1)), which were not significantly different. SP was shown to be a management option in the study area that reduces nitrate leaching, but should be considered cautiously in near-stream areas and near wells where fecal bacteria pollution can be problematic. This study makes an important contribution to our knowledge about interactions between landscape management and environmental quality of the Appalachian region.

Since 1991, wool production per ha from the 200 trees/ha wide-spaced system has been consistently less than in systems (i), (ii) and (iv). Wool production among systems differed significantly since 1992. Expressed as a percentage of wool production achieved on open pasture, the relative values for the agroforestry systems from 1990 to 1994 as follows. [GRAPHICS] The results also show a consistent advantage of the belt arrangement of trees rather than a wide-spaced layout. There are many practical advantages of the belt layout, although timber production may possibly be smaller and offset other gains."	46	6	478-487		Australia	Victoria	-37.56	143.57	Sheep		Silvopasture		Pasture without trees		Livestock growth	Multiple	Negative								Unclear from articleBird2010_2193i	Journal Article	2010	"Bird, P.

The Willandra windbreak was 2 rows of direct-sown black wattle (Acacia mearnsii) aligned south-east-north-west. The Helm View windbreak was 4 rows of mixed Eucalyptus, Casuarina and Acacia spp., aligned east-west. Pastures at both sites had been sown to perennial ryegrass and subterranean clover. Wind direction data indicated that the north-eastern and south-western paddocks at Willandra were sheltered 39 and 28% of the time, respectively. The northern and southern paddocks at Helm View were sheltered 34 and 42% of the time, respectively. The relationship of rainfall with wind speed and direction was examined to indicate the potential of windbreaks of various orientations to protect livestock. The windbreaks had clear effects on pasture production in the competition zone along the margins of the windbreak. Average pasture production at Willandra in the zone 0.5-0.75 H (where H is the windbreak height) was 69% of open yield; production in the 0.9-1.5 H zone was 96%. At Helm View, production in the zone 0.7-1.0 H was 74% of open yield, with 81% in the zone 1.1-1.5 H. Averaged over all years, both windbreaks had no effect on pasture growth in the 2-10 H sheltered zone, although in some years there were small significant growth increases at parts of that zone in certain paddocks. Periodic soil moisture measurements at Willandra showed that water use was greater in the competition zone near the windbreak, with a difference in summer water content of the 1.2 m profile of at least 20 mm between soil 4.6 m from the windbreak and further away. The difference was due to greater water use from the deepest part of the profile. No other effects of the windbreak on soil water content were observed."	42	6	207-218		Australia	Victoria	-37.49	141.83	Sheep		Shelterbelt/Windbreak		Other	Various orientations of the windbreaks	Understory/pasture production		Mixed results (positive and negative)								Bianchetto2015_2202	Journal Article	2015	"Bianchetto, E.; Buscemi, I.; Corona, P.; Giardina, G.; Mantia, T. la; Pasta, S."

Nevertheless, in the last decades, the stability of forest ecosystems has been jeopardized due to the abandonment of traditional agro-pastoral practices, so that the gradual reduction of open areas due to progressive succession processes has caused a high increase of grazing pressure by livestock and wild ungulates feeding on forest areas. This paper aims at showing a methodological approach for evaluating the effect of applying measures in order to improve the grazing value of grasslands and ecotonal patches and lower the grazing impact on native woodlands. A protected area in Sicily (Italy) is considered as a representative case study. The analysis of remotely sensed imagery and several field surveys enabled to identify and map six different land use units subject to grazing, i.e., (1) forests; (2) grasslands (pastures dominated by palatable herbs and grasses); (3) overgrazed grasslands (dominated by poisonous and/or thorny herbs and forbs, not palatable); (4) encroached pastures; (5) roadside firebreaks (dominated by palatable herbs) with no shrubs; and (6) wooded/encroached roadside firebreaks. Several data were collected through sample plots selected within each land use unit, in order to assess their pastoral value. These data have been used to define current and optimal animal stock rates aiming at addressing pasture management planning towards a sustainable use of forestland and shrubland."	7	6	45-52	agroforestry; agroforestry systems; case studies; firebreaks; forbs; forests; grasses; grasslands; grazing; pastures; shrubs; silvopastoral systems; stocking rate; sustainability; woodlands; woody plants	Italy 	Western Sicily 	38.01	13.25	Cattle		Forest grazing		Pasture without trees		Total productivity (pasture + trees)	Improve grazing value of grasslands and lower impact on woodlands 	Positive								Bezkorowajnyj1993_2204	Journal Article	1993	"Bezkorowajnyj, P.

A higher soil penetrometer resistance in the grazed areas pointed to a significant change in soil structure (i.e. dry bulk density) as a result of cattle traffic in the area. In a related experiment comparing the effect of three different levels of soil compaction on tree seedling growth and nitrogen cycling, it was found that water infiltration and nitrogen uptake were reduced in soils treated with a medium and high level of compactive effort. This resulted in a slower rate of growth of the tree seedlings. The addition of an additional nitrogen source improved seedling growth in both the medium and high density compactive treatments."	21	1	65-78		Canada	Ontario 	43.89	-80.31	Cattle		Silvopasture		Other	Soil compaction	Understory/pasture production	Seedling growth rate	Negative				Negative				Bergez1997_2212	Journal Article	1997	"Bergez, J.

Two densities (100 stems.ha(-1) and 400 stems.ha(-1)) were compared. The annual carrying capacity (live weight of the animals that a plot supports) was also recorded as an indirect figure of the overall agricultural production of the system. The silvopastoral plots received less radiation than the agricultural plot without trees, the 400 stems.ha(-1) treatment being more shaded than the 100 stems.ha(-1). Over the measurement period, on some special days, a maximum of 30% of the incoming radiation was intercepted on the 400 stem.ha(-1) treatment with the largest trees. The amount of light intercepted was highly correlated with the type of weather and the leaf area development of the trees: the brighter the day and more expanded the leaf area, the higher was the proportion of radiation intercepted by the tree. However, over the measuring period, a small amount of radiation was intercepted by the tree canopies.

This research assesses the private on-farm financial impact and the public environmental benefit of land use transition from beef grazing to a mixed beef grazing-forestry system in the Richmond River catchment on the east coast of Australia. GIS analysis identified more than 30% of the catchment as beef grazing land potentially available for re-afforestation, across a variety of soil types and geomorphic characteristics.

We also used a multi-criteria approach to assess the environmental outcomes associated with each transition. The results demonstrate that diversification to a mixed beef grazing-forestry system consistently provides environmental benefit, but the financial impact on landholders varies depending on soil type. Landholders on ferrosol and vertosol soils in this catchment have favourable options that can simultaneously deliver private and public benefits, whereas landholders on kurosol and dermosol soils are more restricted, with environmental improvements possible only as a trade-off with farm financial performance.

However, in the temperate regions of Australia their numbers are rapidly declining and they may be lost across much of the landscape in 200 years. Here we examined the spatial distribution of green (GDB), senescent (SDB) and total (TDB) dry pasture biomass, and nutrient status of the GDB fraction around scattered Eucalyptus trees on three parent materials (basalt, granite and meta-sediment) in native and sown pastures across a range of grazed temperate landscapes in northern New South Wales. We used a combination of destructive harvests and a handheld active optical canopy reflectance sensor (AOS) with an integrated GPS to examine pasture biomass around scattered trees. The harvested pasture biomass data indicated that under grazed conditions the presence of scattered trees did not introduce significant radial trends in TDB or GDB out to a distance of 3.5 canopy radii regardless of tree species or parent material. The red and near-infrared reflectance-based Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), as measured by the AOS, did indicate a consistent azimuthal trend with larger GDB on the southern side of the tree and lower GDB on the northern side in the native pasture. However, this observation must be qualified as the regression coefficient for the relationship between NDVI and GDB was significant but weak (best r(2) = 0.42), and SDB reduced its predictive capacity. We also found a higher percentage of GDB under the canopy than in the open paddock. We suggest that the combination of these results may indicate higher grazing pressure under trees than in the open paddock. Pasture nutrient concentration (P, K and S) was higher in both native and sown pastures beneath the tree canopy compared with the open paddock. This study indicates that, in this temperate environment, scattered trees do not adversely affect pasture production, and that they can improve some pasture nutrients."	33	2	7232-7244		Australia	New South Wales	-30.31	151.42	Mixture of sheep and cattle		Wood pasture		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production	Pasture quality higher under trees	No effect								Ayerza1988_2288	Journal Article	1988	"Ayerza, R.; Diaz, R.; Karlin, U."

Rainfall during the experimental period was above average, producing good conditions for pasture growth, which resulted in little influence of stocking rate on pasture or dietary attributes. During the growing season, forage quality, as measured by nitrogen concentration and in vitro digestibility, was higher in sown pasture than in native pasture, and higher in plots with live trees than in plots with killed trees. Treatment differences in herbage quality disappeared later in the year when pastures senesced. In sown pasture treatments, there was no effect of tree killing on legume (Stylosanthes spp.) quality. However, Stylosanthes made a greater contribution to the diet of cattle grazing in wooded paddocks than in paddocks where trees had been killed. The proportion of Stylosanthes in the diet reached a peak in May and then declined. Oversewing increased both diet quality and feed intake while, to a lesser extent, killing trees resulted in generally lower diet quality and feed intake. Estimates of liveweight change were made from the quantities of energy and protein consumed by the cattle. As expected, large increases in liveweight gain were predicted to occur in oversewn pastures compared with native pastures. However, estimates indicated that animal performance may be better where trees are left intact rather than killed. While carrying capacity is greatly increased with the removal of trees, this may be at the expense of individual animal performance. Possible reasons for this significant negative response in dietary attributes and predicted liveweight gain to tree killing are discussed."	131		153-6		Australia		-19.4	145.45	Cattle		Wood pasture		Pasture without trees		Livestock growth		Positive								Arturi2014_2307	Journal Article	2014	"Arturi, Marcelo; Perez, Carolina; Torres Robles, Silvia; Arnal, Mariana"	Tree canopy-herbaceous layer relation in temperate woodland: seasonal variations in forage quantity and quality	Range Management and Agroforestry	0971-2070		<Go to ISI>://WOS:000342882200016	"Tree cover affects herbaceous composition and productivity and can improve forage quality and quantity. We evaluated if tree cover in woodlands co-dominated by deciduous and evergreen have any positive effect on forage availability for domestic and wild herbivores. Species cover, grass and forbs biomass were estimated in five canopy types: (1) no tree cover, (2) full cover of deciduous trees, (3) partial cover of deciduous trees, (4) full cover of evergreen trees and (5) partial cover of evergreen trees. Differences between canopy types in green and total biomass depended on sampling date. In the moderately grazed range, the biomass of green grasses under the partial cover of deciduous trees was higher and lower than in no tree cover areas in winter and summer respectively. In the heavily grazed range, this biomass for both canopy types was similar in all the seasons. Similar C, grass cover was found in winter and spring in no tree cover and under the partial cover of deciduous trees. However, C-4 cover was greater in no tree cover which is likely to be related with the greater standing dead biomass compared with any canopy type. Moreover, temporal variation of green biomass suggests that phenology differs between grasses under different canopy type. Since green biomass was found to be enhanced by different canopy types in different seasons, herbivores might benefit by the combination of canopy types at a landscape scale."	35	1	36-44		Argentina		-35.11	-57.17	Cattle		Forest grazing		Pasture without trees		Understory/pasture production		Mixed results (positive and negative)								Anderson1987_2332	Journal Article	1987	"Anderson, G.

The trees were pruned annually from year 4 and those with poor form were progressively culled until final stand densities of 75, 150 and 225 trees ha-1 were achieved 7 years after planting. The pastures were grazed by sheep from year 4. The sheep carrying capacities of the pastures declined as tree density increased because of competition between trees and pasture and also because of debris from thinning and pruning. In year 7, under the high density trees, the sheep carrying capacity of the pastures was 73% and light transmission was 69% of that of control pastures (no trees) and debris covered about 22% of the pasture. Diameter growth measurements from year 5 to 7 were 7.65, 7, 45 and 6.35 cm for low, medium and high density of trees respectively, which indicates that competition between trees had commenced at the high density (P<0.05). There was little conflict between the agricultural and forestry components at the low stand density with satisfactory production from both. This system has the potential to generate annual income to offset pine establishment and silvicultural costs while providing another source of income in the long term. It is being tried on farm scale by some landholders wishing to diversify from grazing-only enterprises. Ã‚Â© 1987, CSIRO.

Subterranean clover cv. Seaton Park was sown with fertilizer by a method simulating aerial seeding. Pasture, sheep and tree growth and changes in soil and foliar nutrient levels were measured over a four year period. Clover establishment was most satisfactory. In the second year the pastures under tree densities of 150 or more trees/ha carried 60% of the numbers of sheep carried on the pastures with no trees. Two years later, following increased canopy growth and shading, this relative carrying capacity was down to 40%. After four years, soil and foliar nutrient levels were not affected by tree density. At the lowest density of trees (< 100 stems/ha), individual tree diameter growth and volume production per hectare were stimulated and there was least loss of agricultural productivity. This density was therefore preferable for agroforestry.

This report deals with the agronomic aspects of a co-operative study between the Wisconsin Station and the Lake States Forest Experiment Station to measure returns from land used for timber production, woodland pasture and open pasture. Six wire cages each 0.25 mil-acre in size and distributed at random were used to sample each woodland"" pasture area for dry matter production. The forage within each cage was clipped to 2 in. twice during the growing season, dried to a moisture-free basis and weighed. Woodland pastures produce only one-fifth as much forage per acre as open pastures and less than 10 per cent of the yield of renovated pastures.
